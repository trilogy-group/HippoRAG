They have a clear understanding of our product and services.\n- Challenging Customers: Require frequent support and often do not fully understand our product or services.\n- The biggest challenge for advisors, as highlighted by Meaghan, involved several key areas:\n - Consistent Posting of Challenges\n - Inadequate Content Creation: New advisors were expected to post challenging pieces, usually 3 times a week. The content was also a criterion for their progression speed and promotion.\n - Personalized Advice: Many advisors suggested implementing changes in advisors, which is challenging and requires extensive collaboration.\n - Targeted Content: Ensuring that the 4-5 times a week content is specific to member segments.\n- Meaghan's suggestions were well received and she was praised for her innovative approach."
