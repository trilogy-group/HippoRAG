I think this could be a great discussion point for our next meeting. What do you think? Rebecca: I think that's a fantastic idea, Frank! Why don't you start by reflecting on what skills or experiences you think could be leveraged to take on these more strategic responsibilities? Frank Gomi: That's a great question, Rebecca. I have considered some options but would love to hear your thoughts on what I should focus on. Rebecca: I think we should start by identifying the key areas where you feel you could make a significant impact and then explore how we can develop those areas further.

There are a few parameters that are now required which weren't before. This could potentially break existing implementations. How do you suggest we handle this transition?\n\n4.
