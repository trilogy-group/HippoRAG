However, there are still a few issues that need to be addressed in the next patch, which will require some more time.\n\nOur current implementation allows us to:\n\n- Monitor and control the system remotely.\n\n- Automatically detect and report errors.\n\n- Provide a comprehensive overview of the system's performance.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or would like to provide feedback on the slides or any of the key talking points we should address.\n\nThank you,\n\nGeorge"
