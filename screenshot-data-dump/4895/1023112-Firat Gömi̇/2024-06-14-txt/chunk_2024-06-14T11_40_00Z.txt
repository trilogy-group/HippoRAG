Please, or reconsider not using this layout or have different widgets?\nwhat would you add\nas a small, copilot has 4 customers who have enabled it, but still only 2 of them are actively using it.\n\nHere is a detailed report on the customer outreach discussions across the 8 meeting transcripts: The team has explored a variety of approaches to reaching and engaging customers, with varying degrees of success. One common theme that emerged is the need to move away from generic, 'one-size-fits-all' email campaigns and instead adopt a more tailored and targeted outreach strategy. Several meetings highlighted the challenges with the current email approach. The team found that mass emails blast often resulted in low open response rates, as customers tend to ignore generic emails that appear directly to the customer's inbox, and recommended the outsourcing of this personalized email messaging. 2020 Q4's MUSA had the team dig into the importance of conducting interviews and collecting feedback to understand our customers. The team discussed the value of conducting interviews and collecting feedback to better understand their customers."
