S0: Systemic Intelligence \u2014 This is contemporary state-of-the-art AI, namely, universal function approximation mapping from input sensory states to outputs or action states \u2014 that mimics some wild or abstract function or cost of (systemic) states. Examples include deep learning, Bayesian reinforcement learning, etc. S1: Sentient Intelligence \u2014 Sentient behavior or active inference based on belief updating and 'projection' (i.e., determining that beliefs about states as opposed to states per se) where 'sensation' means behavior that looks as if it is driven by beliefs about the sensory consequences of action. This entails planning as inference; namely, inferring courses of action that maximize expected information gain and expected value, where value is part of a generative (i.e., world model; namely, prior preferences. This kind of intelligence is both information-seeking and preference-seeking. It is quintessentially curious, in virtue of being driven by uncertainty minimization, as opposed to reward maximization. S2: Sophisticated Intelligence \u2014 Sentient behavior \u2014 as defined under S1 \u2014 in which plans are predicated on the consequences of action for belief about states of the world, as opposed to states per se, i.e., a move from 'what will happen if I do this?' to 'what will I believe or know if I do this?'. This kind of inference generally uses generative models with discrete states that 'carve nature at its joints'."

He gave a speech praising fellow author Yu Hua and presented a book award to him during the event.\n\n\"The person receiving this award is truly remarkable, and of course, he is also my good friend. He is extraordinary, so I must be, too. A few days ago, I was supposed to write a commendation for him as per tradition, but I struggled for several days and couldn't come up with anything. So I asked a doctoral student to help me by using ChatGPT.\"\n\nThis revelation caused an audible gasp from the audience because Mo Yan, a Nobel Prize winner, used AI to write his speech, which was unexpected.\n\nHe is not the only one. Rie Kudan, the 12th winner of Japan's most prestigious literary award, the Akutagawa Prize, has admitted to using ChatGPT to help write her novel, Tokyo to Dojo-jo. \"Around 5% of the book is made up of AI-generated sentences,\" she said.\n\nAuthor Kudan, who I believe shares my introverted nature, confessed that her frequent interactions with the AI tool allowed her to express her most personal thoughts, which she can't discuss with anyone else. She further revealed that ChatGPT's responses often sparked dialogue in her novel, adding a unique dimension to her writing process."
