You (likely) do not, as you have learned from their mistakes via the ultimate streaming network of life lessons, always on in your head, called instinct. In sum, our instincts help us predict the future. If you get too close to a lion it will eat you, etc. However, there are decisions our society presents whose naive/complexity has outpaced human progress. Just as these challenges are what advances (and hinders) instinct. Our response to 90% of people believe they are above average drivers, few people believe they make a lot of bad decisions ... which makes them especially dangerous. Similar to death, stupidity is more painful for others. Professor Carlo Cipolla's Basic Laws of Human Stupidity break it down:\n\n1. Everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals among us.\n2. The probability that a certain person is stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.\n3. A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person while deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.\n4. Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals.\n5. A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.\n\nProfessor Cipolla brings texture to a common word with a cocktail: stupid"
