I wanted to check in on the meeting time, as the 19th of July is a bit far away, and wanted to know if\nHEMA SHARMA\nHi Firat \u2013 thanks for reaching out.\n\nProject: Partners for a Sustainable World\n\nI have a brief for our marketing plan. I'm focusing on the BCAA bill proceeding with Capitol, so it's not a priority for me. Post-surgery recovery is also key and won't be available for calls. I've attached my notes for our discussion and outlined some focus points. I'm rounding up on the tech schemes. We've started and our project gathered traction when we were laying our previous office. If Capitol will help us deploy our outlined concept, we might want to meet about it sooner.\n\nOtherwise, July is our best timing.\n\nThanks\nElvira Jaffers (elvira@firatsharma.com)\n\nMeeting\nRemind me\nTemplates\nSequences\nCollaborations\nHi Elvira,\n\nFirst of all, I wish you best of luck with your surgery in July. Nothing is more important than health, and I wish that everything goes well for you.\n\nI understand the need to focus on GLM care. I've heard that it takes some time. My support team will inform me if there's anything we can do to help you speed up the process.\n\nCofactor analysis can help you identify old content, but not in a way you can effectively apply. Cofactor would actually work better when you delete the older content, so I'm looking forward to hear your update regarding it.\n\nBe cautious about sharing sensitive information. Elvira@firatsharma.com is outside your organization and isn't in your contacts.\n\nSend\nSend Later\n"
