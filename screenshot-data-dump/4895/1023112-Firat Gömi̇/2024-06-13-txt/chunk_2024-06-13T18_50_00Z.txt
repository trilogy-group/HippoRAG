So they won't have anyone to really focus on testing it.\nThe reason they want to test it -- rather than HR or IT or even community management, these are internal communications people. They want to A) carefully manage messaging around any new features being released, and B) want to minimize the amount of questions / confusion they'd get from their 10k+ users.\nI think they're being overly cautious, but their exec leadership has said that even the name CoPilot -- when they're also testing Microsoft CoPilot internally -- would be confusing to some users. \"Why do we have two searches now?\" \"Why can't this write for me? I thought CoPilot could do that.\" Etc. Seems like dumb objections to me, particularly when their renewal is coming up and they should be wanting to test out new features. But, that's where they're at.\nI have a video guide list created: https://app.guide.com/share/playlists/lnQASMUx7Ro"
