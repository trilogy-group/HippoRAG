I find this very interesting and I wonder if there are any reasons for not enabling it or if you're simply satisfied.\n\nI would like to hear your thoughts about Joe and Chris' pilot; you are a valuable customer for us. Do you have 15 minutes for a Zoom chat soon? https://calendly.com/firat/meeting\n\nYou can also just shoot me your thoughts as a reply to this email. We can be as candid as possible, no feedback is too harsh.\n\nBest,\nFirat"
