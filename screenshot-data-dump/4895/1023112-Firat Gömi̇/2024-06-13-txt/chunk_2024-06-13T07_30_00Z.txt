What do you think?\n\nYesterday 7:35 PM\n\nthe meeting is on the 25th of June, at 4 PM (GMT+2), just wanted to let you know since you mentioned about not knowing the time :)\n\nOut of office - back at 11:00 AM\n\nHistory is on"

I've been to their facility three previous years and we're last to work on that specific instance first.\n\nJesse Manning: Also, I have a meeting later with Cleveland Clinic. I've got nothing for them, and they often don't have anything new. But if you need to swing to get a quick update on their deployment experience, I'm happy to add you to that meeting as well.\n\nJesse Manning: (By Jesse Manning, thanks I'd love to join the meeting with CVT! I'm more than happy to help them start!)\n\nJesse Manning: (For CVT, I already had a meeting with them on Tuesday, and we've talked regarding how they work with us.)"
