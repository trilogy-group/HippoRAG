I've noticed that CoPilot is still not enabled for Clove Brothers, and I'd like to know if there is a reason for that. I've heard much personally about its value from DevFactory and our customers that I am even more interested in your thoughts about it now. Do you have 5 minutes for a chat? I've seen that you've expressed your interest in AI, especially in the summary feature, so I'm even more keen to hear more of your views. I'd like to know how CoPilot could help in our situation or other cases. You can check this link (https://some.link) to learn more about CoPilot and how we enable it with your system admin. Besides these, let me know if I can help you in any way. I'd love to create a connection and help each other.
