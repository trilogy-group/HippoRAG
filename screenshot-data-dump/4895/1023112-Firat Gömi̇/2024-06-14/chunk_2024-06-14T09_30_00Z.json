It's important to highlight the issues we face with our customers directly in these budget discussions. This way, we can address them more effectively and ensure that they are not overlooked.\n\nGeorge D'Souza\n\nI think it's important to discuss the specific issues we've encountered with certain customers. This includes both the problems we've faced and the successes we've had. It's crucial to provide a balanced view to our management.\n\nLebouef Hélène\n\nI believe it's essential to bring up the challenges we face with customer engagement. Many times, customers are not responsive or are difficult to reach. Highlighting these challenges can help us strategize better ways to engage them.\n\nThibault Brisebois\n\nIt's also important to mention the positive aspects of our interactions with customers. While there are challenges, there are also significant successes that should be highlighted.\n\nTHEM ABAB\n\nI think it's crucial to discuss how we can improve our customer interactions. This includes discussing potential strategies for better engagement and addressing any issues that have arisen.\n\nThibault Brisebois\n\nI will finish with a call and add my insights by the time of our call\n\nGeorge D'Souza\n\nFor Cplink, there is also the fact that [the text is cut off]"

And this lead to creating two different service flavors:\n\nNew Acquisitions (e.g., Tivan, Intuitive)\n\nWe want to leverage the curiosity and willingness of new customers to engage and participate, thus establishing a more productive relationship from the beginning. We aim to follow a 4 stage framework:\n- Establish engagement\n- Help define a structured process that takes under two weeks and that experiences a focus group of engaged customers. PMs will focus on those customers and the rest of the customers will be in BU’s responsibility if non-responsive or not interested\n- Understanding insights\n- Internal fields are dedicated to engaging with the customer base to understand their needs and gather valuable insights. The insights will serve not only the current projects, but will overall improve our understanding of the customer base and their challenges.\n- Selling the value\n- Before building the product we will validate the project idea by presenting it to customers and collecting feedback that will drive further iterations. As often as possible, we will use CNU to create fast, simple, focused POCs that can help in this process.\n- Building\n- Involves building the solution into the product. Note: that is not to say that development is blocked in the meanwhile; work can in most cases start ahead of time.\n\nOld Acquisitions\n\nOur expectations in terms of getting customer engagement are not high for these products. Here we will adopt a fail-fast strategy where if the engagement efforts fail, we will take the details back to the business and the product team to decide how that impacts the product plans."
