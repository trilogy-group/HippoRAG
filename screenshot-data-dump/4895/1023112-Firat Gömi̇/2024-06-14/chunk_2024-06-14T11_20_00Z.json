And this is leading to creating two different service flavors:\n\nNew Acquisitions (e.g. Tivan, Influitive)\n\nWe want to leverage the curiosity and willingness of new customers to engage and participate, thus establishing a more productive relationship from the beginning. We aim to follow a 4 stage framework:\n- Establish engagement\n- Help define a structured process that takes under two weeks and that creates a focused group of engaged customers. PMs will focus on those customers and the rest of the customers will be in BU's responsibility if non-responsive or not interested\n- Understanding insights\n- Internal efforts are dedicated to engaging with the customer base to understand their needs and gather valuable insights. The insights will serve not only the current projects, but will overall improve our understanding of the customer base and their challenges.\n- Selling the value\n- Before building the product we will validate the project idea by presenting it to customers and collecting feedback that will drive further iterations. As often as possible, we will use CNU to create fast, simple, focused POCs that can help in this process.\n- Building\n- Involves building the solution into the product. Note: that is not to say that development is blocked in the meanwhile; work can in most cases start ahead of time.\n\nOld Acquisitions\n\nOur expectations in terms of getting customer engagement are not high for these products. Here we will adopt a fail-fast strategy where if the engagement efforts fail, we will take the details back to the business and the product team to decide how that impacts the product plans."
