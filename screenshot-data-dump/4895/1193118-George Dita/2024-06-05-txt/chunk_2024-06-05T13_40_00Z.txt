We have identified several risks associated with the current implementation that could potentially lead to a failure in meeting PCI certification standards. The main issues are: - Lack of encryption in some areas (DB and file storage) which could lead to data breaches. - Inadequate error handling which could expose sensitive information. - The use of outdated software components that are no longer supported by their developers. We recommend the following actions: - Accelerate the encryption implementation across all vulnerable points (DB and file storage) immediately. - Review and enhance error handling procedures to ensure that no sensitive data is exposed. - Update all software components to the latest versions to ensure support and security. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. Regards, John"
