Prompting these actions to happen before the situation is taken too far was vital, especially for some of our more volatile and less predictable customers.\n\n- Lack of Resource Concerns: Customers who presented concerns that were not related to lack of resources, thereby eliminating some of the most frequent and easy-to-resolve challenges. Often times additional costs, if any, might not be large.\n\n- Sufficient Budget: Some did not voice their struggles, leading to a lack of engaging opportunities. Even if they were not active challenges we pursue, awareness levels are likely to remain high.\n\n- Lead Engagement: Customers who had a higher engagement collectively did not see significant problems that couldn't be resolved more than others of their status, and were not as needy, hence were able to actively engage and maintain their positions.\n\nUnsuccessful Customers:\n\n- Lack of Authority: Those who complained regarding a lack of financial challenges, relying on others to resolve their pricing issues. This led to a lack of authority and decision-making capabilities, which often resulted in a lack of engagement.\n\n- Pricing Challenges: Customers who were particularly sensitive to pricing and were often the first to voice their concerns. This led to a lack of engagement and a decrease in overall satisfaction.\n\n- Resource Limitations: Customers who had significant resource limitations, leading to their frequent and often unresolved challenges. This led to a lack of engagement and a decrease in overall satisfaction.\n\n- Frequent Complaints: Customers who frequently complained about various issues, leading to a lack of engagement and a decrease in overall satisfaction.\n\nLack of Authority and Pricing: This led to a lack of authority and decision-making capabilities, which often resulted in a lack of engagement and a decrease in overall satisfaction.\n\nThe above points are a brief overview of the types of customers who have been either successful or unsuccessful based on the challenges they faced and how they were managed."

Utilizing Opportunities: Meghan noted that sometimes additional opportunities, such as special promotions or challenges in a project, could arise unexpectedly. - Effective Communication: Meghan emphasized the importance of clear, effective communication in order to keep all parties informed during the project. - Create an action plan early, to avoid miscommunication and ensure that each step in the process is well thought out."
