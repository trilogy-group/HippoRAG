I understand the urgency and the potential risks involved. Here are a few points I'd like to discuss further:\n\n1. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies.\n2. Timeline for implementation and testing.\n3. Budget considerations and resource allocation.\n\nI think it's crucial we address these issues as soon as possible to ensure we don't fail the upcoming certification. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this in detail.\n\nBest regards,\n[Name Redacted]"

Additionally, it is imperative to address the risk of failing the next PCI certification audit by enhancing our security measures.\n\nPlease arrange for a meeting with all relevant stakeholders to discuss this further.\n\nRegards,\n\nChris White\n\n---\n\nAttachment: Document.pdf"
