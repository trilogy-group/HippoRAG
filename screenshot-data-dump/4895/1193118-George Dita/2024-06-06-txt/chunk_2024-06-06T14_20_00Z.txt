I'm reaching out to you today to discuss some potential ways to enhance the development of our upcoming features and better understand your needs.\n\nWe are working on new features regarding AI-enhanced customer analytics, and we would like to get your insights.\n\nWhat we require:\n\n- You will need to meet with each of our software teams, product managers, and other project leads to hear first-hand what the product teams need.\n\n- We also expect you to influence the future plans of our product directly.\n\nThere is no response time commitment, as it can be just one 30-minute chat or several meetings spread out over a few weeks. I am looking forward to discussing any ideas you have and setting aside some time to meet.\n\nBest regards,\n\nGeorge Doe"
