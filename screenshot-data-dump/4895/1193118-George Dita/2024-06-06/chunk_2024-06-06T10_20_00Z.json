However, I believe that our team has put in a lot of effort and that the current draft is very close to what you are looking for.\n\nI still believe we can meet the mark, but I see your frustration and understand your concerns. I hope we can resolve this amicably and move forward.\n\nThe RFP draft remains largely unchanged from yesterday's version.\n\nThe RFP draft remains largely unchanged from yesterday's version.\n\nI will keep trying to understand why the new meeting is necessary.\n\nReply to John"
