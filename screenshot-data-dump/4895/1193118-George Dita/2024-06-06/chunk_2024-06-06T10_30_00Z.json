Can you please tell me more about it?\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew\n\nHi,\n\nI think I now understand what you're asking. Here's what I suggest:\n\n- First, we need to look at the data.\n\n- Then, we need to talk to the team about how they manage data.\n\n- Finally, we need to look at the system that manages the data.\n\nLet me know if this helps!\n\nThanks,\n\nAndrew"
