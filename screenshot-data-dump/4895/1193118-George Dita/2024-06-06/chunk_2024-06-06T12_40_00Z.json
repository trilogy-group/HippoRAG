                    "visibleText": "Unconscious Customer\n\nUnconscious customer engagement roughly translates to a habitual purchasing process formed by the customer. When a customer engages in a habitual process, they are less likely to be influenced by competitive offers.\n\nBecause their past positive experiences have set their expectations for future experiences, they are less likely to seek alternatives or even consider new options. This type of engagement is powerful because it creates a strong emotional connection with the brand, which can be difficult to break.\n\nLack of Control\n\nThis type of engagement means losing control of their choices, leading to an unconscious loyalty to a brand. Customers are not actively making a decision to stay with a brand; rather, they are passively continuing because it has become a habit.\n\nWhat did the customers struggle most with?\n\nCustomer Needs: Aligning customer needs with business goals is a key component. Customers often have different expectations, which can lead to misunderstandings and poor service. Properly aligning these expectations with the company's capabilities is crucial in maintaining customer loyalty.\n\nFor example, a customer who expects high-quality products may be disappointed if the company's actual offerings are of lower quality than expected. This can lead to dissatisfaction and eventually, loss of the customer.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement: To improve customer engagement, companies should focus on creating a more conscious engagement strategy. This involves being more aware of customer needs and actively working to meet them, rather than relying on habitual loyalty.\n\nThe report states: 'To have a balanced mix of educational, and high-value tasks keeps members engaged.'"
