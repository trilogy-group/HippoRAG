Once logged in, click on your profile 'avatar' in the upper right-hand corner of the dashboard.\n3. Accounts Details. In the Settings menu, look for a section titled 'Account Details' or a similar concept. This is typically where the 'Time Zone' setting is located.\n4. Time Zone Settings. Within the Account Details or General Settings menu, find the Time Zone setting where the default time zone for your account is displayed and can be edited.\nThe default time zone setting will affect various operations within your HubSpot account, including the timing of automated emails and other scheduled types of interactions. It's good practice to ensure that this setting is in line with your primary business location (especially if your primary business location changes or you engage with your customers internationally).\n\nHow can I check the account default?"
