I didn't know how to write the copy of my landing pages, which content to write for my blog, and so on.\n\nAt the same time, a large number of competitors were already present and arrived in the short future.\n\nPlus, in the end, I didn't feel a great founder product fit. I have built a community on Twitter/20k of followers, and almost nobody was in overlap with the target audience of Userdesk. This meant an extra effort for me to find new clients.\n\nIn December 2023 I launched my Next.js SaaS Boilerplate Shipped.club, and I loved working on it, and helping other developers and aspiring SaaS owners to achieve their goals. This fits much better with my expertise and values — it's simply a better fit for me.\n\nLesson learned: founder product fit matters much more than I expected.\n\nWhat did go well?\n\nI loved working with AI tech, and I think it has huge potential, now and in the future. It's not a bubble. And who knows, maybe in the future I will work on an AI product again.\n\nI found my customers mainly from AI directories. A lot of AI enthusiasts use them to discover new products, and it also brought a good domain rate, with very few blog posts written."

If you’ve already gone through the mind-bending journey of rationalizing, rejecting, and ultimately embracing the magic of vector embeddings, then feel free to skip this section.\n\nVanilla RAG (def): A single-step semantic search engine that stores business knowledge, such as support documents, in a vector database, such as Pinecone, using an off-the-shelf embedding model. Information retrieval is then performed by creating a vector embedding from the text of the question and using a comparison metric, such as cosine similarity, to rank the top-k most relevant documents."
