We spent more than 6 months testing GPT-4 and making it even safer, and with it on its way of alignment research that we pursued in anticipation of models like GPT-4.\n\nWe expect to continue to ramp up our safety precautions more proactively than many of our users would like. Our general sense is far from model GPT-3 ship to be not met aligned anymore, and it's been crucial for each model we (initially) deployed without any special alignment. GPT-3 (aligned enough to be deployed in ChatGPT), and now GPT-4 performs much better on all our safety mechanisms than GPT-3.\n\nWe believe and have been saying in policy discussions with (governments) that powerful training inputs should be reported to governments, the capability and increasingly sophisticated predictions of behavior accompanied by, and requisite best practices such as dangerous capability testing, weak governance of large-scale compute usage, safety standards, and the retention of lesson-sharing from deployment are good ideas, but the details really matter and should adapt over time as the technology evolves. It's also important to address the whole spectrum of risks from present-day issues to GPT, preventing misuse or self-harm, mitigating bias to longer-term existential ones.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@yashbhaskar/gpt5-everything-we-know-about-it-7c6c0c987b88"
