For example, 20th-century literature depicted a fast-paced society dominated by faceless technologies and machine learning, transforming traditional literature.\n\nThe internet, digital media, and other innovations have expanded vocabulary, language use, and literary expression. Globalization has influenced writing styles, and social media has also impacted literary expression.\n\nWriting systems typically develop more slowly than spoken counterparts, often preserving characteristics and idioms lost to the spoken language.\n\nThe evolution of languages is directly linked to our ability to communicate with each other and the wider population. English, for example, has been influenced by various native languages over the ages and has assimilated interesting words and phrases, making it richer and more appealing. (The Nigerian pidgin language serves as a great example of this).\n\nIt's not just about changing the words we use but also how we use them. Our culture, beliefs, fashion, values, art, and technology shape our communication.\n\nAs language evolves and responds to cultural shifts, writers play a key role in reflecting and influencing these changes through their work. They capture the spirit of the times in their narratives, which can influence how people think and speak.\n\nTherefore, a great way to develop a unique voice is to translate your spoken language into writing. Write in your distinct cultural, educational, social, and personal context to make your voice heard."
