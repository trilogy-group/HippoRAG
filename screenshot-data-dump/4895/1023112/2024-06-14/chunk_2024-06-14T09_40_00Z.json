CPMs are not in perfect control, and they add such multiple times.\n\nWho are these comms managers?\n\nDragos Ilie\n\nAlso, from some customers, I've heard them saying “we've told this multiple times to others at your company”, which means they have been repeating concerns alone that have been addressed internally and sorted, but they are quite eager that before the case has been sort of fixed but hope they are hesitant in engaging new conversations, as they have a lack of trust in our process, and would like to get response that they can be comfortable here being heard in new features.\n\nWho are these comms managers?\n\nDragos Ilie\n\nThey are like the system admin at some companies, MIT, Smith, Hammas, Choice Hotels and Custom Biologics said this directly at the morning mail example, even they can not meet active customers till they add some visit when they restart to set up focus on our CPMs document only. Other failing systems do they decided to speed up the process of engagement. Obviously, it's still very engaging."

Not their priority for them, and they had this multiple times.\n\nDragos Ilie\n\nwho are these comms managers?\n\nalso, from some customers, I heard them saying 'we told this multiple times to others at company, which states they have been exploring before (on time state from hubspot emails and sessions, but they are new customers, that they have lost a lot of our processes, and they are hesitant in engaging once again not as other concerns have been addressed, so would like to get response to their concerns before hearing about new features\n\nDragos Ilie\n\nwho are these comms managers?\n\nthey are like the system admin at the company. IT, Swift, Hamama, Choice Hotels and Quest Diagnostics said this directly at their meeting.
