    "The user is actively engaged in multiple tasks. Initially, they are navigating the Crossover platform, specifically the 'Skills Assessments Preview' section, which includes details about various skills such as 'Using Generative AI', 'Writing Code - Data Structures & Algorithms', and 'Cloud Engineering for AWS'. The user is likely reviewing or managing skill assessments, as indicated by the detailed breakdown of time and costs associated with each skill.",
    "The user then transitions to Visual Studio Code, where they are working on a TypeScript file named 'campaign.ts'. The code involves configuring campaign settings with specific patterns and sheets for 'gads' and 'gads_new'. The user is also running a task to collect campaign results, as indicated by the terminal output showing SQL queries and the status of the running task. This suggests the user is involved in backend development, possibly related to campaign management or data processing.",
    "Later, the user is seen using GitHub Desktop, where they are interacting with a repository named 'tools'. The user is performing actions such as revealing files in the file explorer and preparing to commit changes. The presence of a README.md file and a .gitattributes file indicates that the user is setting up or maintaining repository configurations, which is a common task in version control and project setup."
  ],
  "aiUseSummary": "The user is utilizing the AI tool 'Cody' within Visual Studio Code for coding assistance. Specifically, the AI tool is providing error messages and suggestions related to the user's project. For instance, the AI indicates an error with 'Cody Embeddings' and provides a detailed message about the issue, which helps the user identify that the project directory does not appear to be a git repository. This interaction highlights the user's reliance on AI for debugging and resolving issues efficiently, thereby enhancing productivity.",
