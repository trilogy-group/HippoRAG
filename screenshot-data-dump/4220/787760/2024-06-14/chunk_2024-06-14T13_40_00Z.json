Create a new directory named package into which you will install your dependencies.\n\nmkdir package\n\nNote that for a .zip deployment package, Lambda expects your source code and its dependencies all to be at the root of the zip file. However, installing dependencies directly in your project directory can introduce a large number of new files and folders and make navigating around your IDE difficult. You create a separate package directory here to keep your dependencies separate from your source code.\n\nInstall your dependencies in the package directory. The example below installs the Boto3 SDK from the Python Package Index using pip. If your function code uses Python packages you have created yourself, save them in the package directory.\n\npip install --target ./package boto3\n\nCreate a .zip file with the installed libraries at the root.\n\ncd package\nzip -r ../my_deployment_package.zip ."

The console is in the process of loading the function's code. This indicates that the user is likely preparing to review or edit the Lambda function's code.",
    "At 13:43:38, the user is researching how to package Python dependencies for AWS Lambda functions. They are viewing the AWS Lambda Developer Guide, which provides instructions on creating a new directory for dependencies, installing the Boto3 SDK using pip, and creating a .zip file for deployment. This suggests that the user is working on deploying a Python-based Lambda function and is ensuring they follow best practices for packaging dependencies.",
    "At 13:49:18, the user is using Total Commander, a file management tool, to organize and manage project files. The left panel shows directories and files related to a project named 'yo-hiring-utilities', including directories for source code, node modules, and various configuration files. The right panel shows the contents of a directory named 'campaign-tracking', which includes various Python packages and dependencies. This indicates that the user is preparing or managing the files necessary for their Lambda function deployment."
