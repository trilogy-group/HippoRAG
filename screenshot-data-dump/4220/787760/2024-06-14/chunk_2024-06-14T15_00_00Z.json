  "activitySummary": [
    "The user started their session by working with Docker Desktop. They were managing a container named 'stoic_khayyam' and were viewing the file structure within this container. The user navigated through directories such as 'boot', 'dev', 'etc', and 'home'. They also viewed the contents of a shell script file named 'lambda-entrypoint.sh', which included environment variable settings and runtime entry points for AWS Lambda functions.",
    "The user then proceeded to turn off the Docker Engine, as indicated by the message 'Turning off the Docker Engine...' on the Docker Desktop interface. This action was likely taken to free up system resources or to stop the container operations temporarily.",
    "Next, the user switched to Visual Studio Code, where they were actively working on a TypeScript file named 'campaign.ts'. The code in this file involved importing functions from 'salesforce' and 'gsheets' modules and defining a configuration object 'campaignConf' for handling campaign data from various sources like Facebook and Google Ads. The user was running a debugging session, as indicated by the 'Collect campaign results' process running in the terminal.",
    "The user also had multiple tabs open in Visual Studio Code, suggesting they were working on different parts of the project simultaneously. The terminal output showed environment variables and paths related to AWS services, indicating that the user was working on a cloud-based application, possibly involving data processing or integration tasks."
