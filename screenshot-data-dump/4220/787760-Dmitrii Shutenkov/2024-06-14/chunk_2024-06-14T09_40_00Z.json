  "activitySummary": [
    "The user is actively engaged in writing code within Visual Studio Code. They are working on a Python script named 'salesforce.py' which involves creating a query function to interact with Salesforce data. The code includes importing the 'simple_salesforce' library, defining a function 'create_query' that constructs a SOQL query based on provided ID patterns and dates, and handling exceptions for missing patterns. The user is also seen editing the 'config.json' and 'lambda_function.py' files, indicating a broader scope of work related to Salesforce integration.",
    "In another instance, the user is working on a TypeScript file named 'campaign.ts' within the same IDE. The code involves defining functions to process query results, construct SQL queries, and fetch data asynchronously. The user is seen logging the constructed queries and measuring the execution time, which suggests they are debugging or optimizing the query performance. The terminal output shows the execution of SQL queries and the refreshing of tokens, indicating active testing and validation of the code.",
    "The user is also conducting research on handling exceptions in Python. They have a web browser open with a search query related to 'throw exception python' and are viewing the official Python documentation on input and output. This indicates that the user is looking for best practices or specific methods to handle exceptions in their Python code, which aligns with the code seen in 'salesforce.py'."
