The user is likely analyzing or updating data related to different campaigns, as indicated by the visible text in the spreadsheet.",
    "The user then switches to Visual Studio Code, where they are working on a Python project named 'campaign-tracking'. The open files include 'test.py', 'requirements.txt', 'lambda_function.py', 'gsheets.py', 'config.json', 'Dockerfile', and 'salesforce.py'. The user is writing and testing Python code, specifically a function named 'classifyApplication' that classifies applications based on their stage names and last active stages. The terminal output shows that the user is running tests and retrieving records from a database.",
    "The user returns to the Google Sheets document, this time focusing on a different sheet named 'Pivot Table 1'. The visible text includes various percentages and counts, indicating that the user is analyzing data related to campaign performance across different regions. The user is likely using pivot tables to summarize and interpret the data, which helps in making informed decisions about the campaigns."
