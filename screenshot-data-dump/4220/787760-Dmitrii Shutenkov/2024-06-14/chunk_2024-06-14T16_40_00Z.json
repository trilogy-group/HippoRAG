    "During the captured timeframe, the user was primarily engaged with the 'explorer' application. The screenshots show the user navigating through various directories and files on their computer. There are no visible signs of the user writing or reviewing code, reading or writing specifications, or engaging in any form of communication such as emails or chats. The user appears to be organizing or searching for files, as indicated by the open file explorer windows.",
    "The screenshots do not show any active development tools, IDEs, or document viewers. The user is solely interacting with the file explorer, which suggests that their activities are focused on file management tasks. There are no indications of the user conducting research, attending meetings, or using any AI tools during this period. The absence of other applications or browser windows further supports the conclusion that the user's activities are limited to file exploration and management."

  "aiUseSummary": "There is no evidence of AI tool usage in the provided screenshots. The user is not interacting with any AI chat interfaces, IDE extensions, or other AI-driven applications. The activities are confined to file management within the explorer application, with no visible AI assistance or interaction.",
