It makes use of four hands-on coding challenges that you can take in a language of your choice. The simplest task covers basic control flow and common data types and complexity grows gradually with the remaining tasks, up to writing clever mini-algorithms where algorithmic efficiency counts. The tasks require nothing more than the common language constructs & functions; no specific libraries or frameworks are required.
