  "activitySummary": [
    "The user is actively engaged in writing code within Visual Studio Code. The open files include 'test.py', 'requirements.txt', 'lambda_function.py', 'gsheets.py', 'config.json', 'dump.json', and an untitled file. The user is working on a project named 'campaign-tracking'. The terminal output shows commands being executed, indicating active development and testing. The user is handling JSON data, making API requests, and processing the responses. The terminal output also shows SQL queries being executed, suggesting database interactions.",
    "The user is working on a Python script named 'test.py' within the 'campaign-tracking' project. The script imports necessary libraries such as 'json', 'requests', and 'datetime'. It includes an example of an API request, handling JSON data, and performing more complex JSON operations. The terminal output shows the execution of the script, with messages indicating the number of records found. This suggests the user is testing the script and verifying its functionality.",
    "The user is editing multiple configuration files such as 'config.json' and 'dump.json'. These files contain JSON data structures, which are likely used for configuring the application or storing data. The user is also working on a 'Dockerfile', indicating the use of containerization for the project. The presence of a 'requirements.txt' file suggests the user is managing project dependencies, which is a common practice in Python projects."
