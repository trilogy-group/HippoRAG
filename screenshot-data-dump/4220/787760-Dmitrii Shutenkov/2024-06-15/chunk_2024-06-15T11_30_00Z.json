The user is modifying the query to filter results by creation date and is viewing the returned records. This activity indicates that the user is analyzing or validating data related to identity proofs, possibly for reporting or further processing.",

The returned records are displayed in a table format, and the user has options to update, delete, undelete, purge, or view the records in Salesforce. This suggests that the user is managing and maintaining data integrity within the Salesforce environment."
