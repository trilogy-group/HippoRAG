You can use this key or your own, but please note that the provided key has a token quota.\nAddresses the requirements in the order listed.\nDeliverables should include the code developed within this notebook, and a spreadsheet containing results across separate sheets.\nComments detailing your thought process are appreciated.\n\nRequirements\n1. Classify emails\nClassify each email as either a 'product inquiry' or an 'order request'. Ensure that the classification accurately reflects the intent of the email.\nOutput: Populate the email-classification sheet with columns: email ID, response.\n\n2. Process order requests\n1. Process order requests in the order they are received. For each request, verify product availability in stock. If the order can be fully fulfilled, create a new order line with the status created. If the order cannot be fully fulfilled, create a line with the status out of stock. After placing the order add new lines in the data sheet created."
