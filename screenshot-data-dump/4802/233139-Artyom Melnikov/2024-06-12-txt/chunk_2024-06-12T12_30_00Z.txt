The user is working on complex conditional logic to determine the performance and cost-effectiveness of different sourcing platforms like 'Indeed' and 'LinkedIn'. The code includes multiple 'IF' statements and mathematical operations to calculate these metrics.",

For example, comments like 'Indeed - clearly expensive' and 'no indirect conversions & no recent activity' provide context to the calculations being performed. This indicates that the user is not only writing code but also documenting it for better understanding and future reference. The user is focused on ensuring that the formulas accurately reflect the performance metrics and are well-documented.",

There are no indications of the user switching to other applications or performing different tasks.
