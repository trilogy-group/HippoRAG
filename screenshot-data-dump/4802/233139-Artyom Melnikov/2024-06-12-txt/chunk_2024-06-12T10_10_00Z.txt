Meaning is indeed an issue caused by low frequency of exposure. For 20 cases which are resolvable currently I did smoke check. Reasons are variable, no resume at all, 3 resume rejection within 6-12 hours before rejection and was not synced, probably due to candidate having no badges acquired.\n1 unread 5 replies Yesterday 8:32 PM\nDragos Nuta Yesterday 7:43 PM\nI have new statistics for Job Recommendations in Reject emails over different funnels. For abc:\n* Generated 134 job recommendations\n* Sent approximately 184 (76 + 108) rejection emails with job recommendations (not exact number, because there were permission issue which prevented some of emails to be sent)\n* Number of applications created by rejected candidates who followed job recommendations from email: 14.\nDenys, can you share an update on this please?\nDenys Yefimenko 1 min\nPlease remind me how to access shared quicksight dashboards.
