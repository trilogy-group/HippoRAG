Investigate when that happens\n* First, investigate what is happening with these candidates. Are these all candidates who applied, took CAT right away and then failed on another badge? that is unlikely.\n* Some job recommendations take roughly 2 minutes to be created, close to the delay we have in SF, increasing it to 5 minutes\n* There are occasions where LFM fails to output proper json, investigate root cause\n* Currently we generate job recommendations and filter them down to maximum 3 considering interests/#recommendations initially\n* Improve tracking of the recommendations we send in emails, currently we do not know from the first glance what was sent, use #OpportunityDescriptionField for that\n* Job recommendations expiration (Update Apex class to recompute job recommendations when the recommendation is older than 24h)\n* Job recommendations and candidate badger from SF instead of other campaigns\n\nThis is valuable, but lower prio than drip campaigns"
