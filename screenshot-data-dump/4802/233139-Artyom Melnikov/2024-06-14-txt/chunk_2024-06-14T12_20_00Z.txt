Rather than the student answering questions on pre-generated content, they will be actively involved in creating their own learning paths.\n\nSocial: Enable students to collaboratively create stories together with their friends - sharing the creative process.\n\nAcademic rigor: We do the above to get students to want to put more time and energy into reading than they currently do.\n\n# Important Business Decisions\n\nWhat are the most important business decisions that will ensure the success of the product? \n\n# Product Context\n\n# Core Features\n\nHow do we deliver that outcome?
