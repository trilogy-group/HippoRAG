For sections, where there is no relevant content, state that explicitly instead of removing the section.\n\n3. For each function that you have identified in the L2 document, create a new L3 context document: `L3_module-function-context-template.md`\n 1. Copy the contents of the Context Pack - L3 Template into the new document\n 2.

For all non-trivial function, method and block of code in the class or file, create comments explaining the code.\n\n6. Benchmark your new Context Pack (see below):\n 1. Increase rate by improving the Context Pack and benchmarking tests until AI using the Context Pack performs at least `10%` higher than \"without context\"\n 2. The acceptable rate \"with context\" is <5%\n\n7. Inconclusive rate \"with context\" is <5%\n\n# Benchmarking a Context Pack\n\n1. Create a benchmarking config file for the Context Pack in the `L4_second-brain-benchmark` directory.\n 1. Define tests i.e. practical tasks in the context of the product, designed to verify the AI's ability to successfully solve tasks within the areas described in the Context Pack.\n 2. Make sure that your tests and assertions cover all the scope provisions from the Context Pack.\n 3. Tasks must be high-level (functional), i.e. at the same level as your regular Jira tasks received, or higher.\n 4. Assertions must be deterministic and easy to verify by AI with consistent outcome.\n 5. Assertions must be narrow in scope (i.e. \"smart\" EDA), \"Less than 20 lines\"; 5000c; \"properly named variables\".\n 6. Assertions must only verify if AI correctly used information in the Context Pack (i.e. \"task implemented correctly\") and must verify that the AI has made all the necessary changes in all the right places."
