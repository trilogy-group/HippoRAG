Now it will load and cache credentials, that will be required to pass to the AWS Clients. For example:\n\n```typescript\n// Somewhere during the init\nAwsConfig.LoadAwsCredentials('profileName') Later in the code\nconst s3 = new S3Client({ credentials: AwsConfig.defaultCredentials() });\n```\n\n`AwsConfig.defaultCredentials()` will either return cached credentials from the `AwsConfig.LoadAwsCredentials` invocation, or undefined, to allow AWS Client to fallback to default logic."
