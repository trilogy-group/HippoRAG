EDP and private pricing discount programs are in good shape.\n• Waste: working to solve $200k+ of wasted reservations on eu-north-1. The remaining waste found was either resolved or known by the SaaSops Cost team.\n• Reservation and Centralization: We have an additional ~100k cost reduction opportunities that will require mini systems (FS reservation; RDS optimization, centralization, and reservations).\n• Independently, West East has made a number of product-level recommendations: these will have to be reviewed by TPMs to establish and then handled through mini sessions.\n• Providing updates during renewal: TPM will provide content to Renewals that talks about product investments which will be made available to customers during the renewal process\n• AI Feature Usage:An API is now available for tracking AI feature usage. It collects information about customers, users, feature usage as well as technical details on model use, tokens, etc.\n• Link: https://ai-feature-adoption-dash.s3.amazonaws.com Slots\n\nJigsaw (1 slot)\n• 1 commit defense goal: delivered, release made available to customers with 4 customers requesting access to date\n• 1 stretch defense goal: canceled in agreement with the BU after assessing its value\n• 4 new defense goals were added mid-quarter: 2 already delivered, 1 pending completion by EQo2 and the 4th blocked on the customer side\n\nCommit: Upgrade Messenger to Java 11, fix two vulnerabilities, support three OSes\n• Lufthansa failed the PCI audit due to security issues with Monitor - this is now fixed\n• SoftwareAG was blocked from upgrading its white-label product because the interceptor did not support Java 11. We have released a version that will enable that upgrade.\n• We have confirmed $11M out of $12M planned ARR customers, but we are seeing low adoption: \n• Half (10) of high ARR customers who requested the changes answered our request for deployment plans\n• Our customers are very supportive. Only 4 (5%) customers asked for new versions but didn't plan upgrading in Q2. We will reach out to the entire customer base but, most likely, no customers will upgrade within Q2."

If deploying a clean instance is part of operating the product (e.g. you do it for every customer) then it should be part of import. But if it's a \"singleton\" SaaS platform then the only reason to move is because of this AWS accounting mumbo jumbo.\nDavid Schwartz 8:42AM\nIts like 1M USD\nso its not just mumbo jumbo\nThanks!

The user is likely preparing or reviewing a status report or project update, as indicated by the structured format and specific details mentioned in the document.",
    "The user is also researching AI feature adoption metrics on a web page hosted on Amazon S3. The page contains various charts and graphs that display data on the number of transactions by feature, input and output tokens by feature, and the number of unique customers by feature over time. This suggests that the user is analyzing the performance and usage of different AI features, possibly to inform future development or marketing strategies.",
    "In addition to document editing and research, the user is engaged in a team chat on Gmail. The chat, titled 'tpm reboot', involves multiple participants discussing the complexities of deploying clean instances of products, compliance with SAM templates, and the challenges associated with AWS accounting. The conversation indicates a collaborative effort to address technical and operational issues, with participants sharing their insights and opinions."
