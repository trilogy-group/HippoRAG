The Google Ads interface shows a comprehensive table layout with columns for campaign type, budget, status, impressions, CTR, cost, clicks, conversion value, and other metrics. This detailed view suggests that the user is analyzing the effectiveness of the campaigns and possibly making decisions on budget adjustments, targeting, and optimization strategies.",
    "The user is also seen navigating through different tabs within the Google Chrome browser, which includes tabs for Google Meet and Google Ads. The presence of multiple tabs and the active engagement in the video conference indicate that the user is multitasking, possibly switching between the meeting discussion and the campaign data analysis. The taskbar icons suggest that the user has access to various productivity tools such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams, although these were not actively used during the captured timeframe."
