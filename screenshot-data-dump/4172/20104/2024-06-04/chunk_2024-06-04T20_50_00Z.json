Delays in handling legacy backlog ($578K ARR impact)\nThe focus during the first quarter was to complete the import and reduce the maintenance backlog. The decision was to not import the maintenance backlog and instead work on the backlog that had been backfired as some of the ongoing issues were high severity ones and led to customer dissatisfaction.\n\nExamples:\nAWS Case: AWS, the largest single customer loss ($700K), cited a bug that was identified before the acquisition. The issue was raised in Nov 2021 and was resolved after completing the import & cost reduction.\nThere was another sev1 issue that was incompletely fixed by the engineering team. There was set of already paid for but not delivered work (features) that were Engineering\nLinkedIn app was not working for more than a year due to outdated API. The import was completed by Jan 17 for PostBeyond and Jan 19 for LinkedIn.\n\nImmediate Next Steps:\nContinue working through the maintenance backlog; estimating\n\nProcess Improvements:\nAll outstanding issues MUST be reviewed by BU/TPM/Eng and added to the internal bug ticketing system, along with any promised dates that are missed. All bug fixes implemented by the legacy team post acquisition MUST be reviewed as we cannot blindly rely on legacy team's deliveries.\nStart the maintenance review work in the first quarter and factor this into the annual planning. We should combine maintenance and start teams until we reduce the backlog to sensible levels.\nThis will allow everyone to focus on what is really important vs spending time on bugs - this will help with set schedules.\nIf there are plenty of bugs - this will help reducing the backlog to sensible levels.\nWe need to define some backup plans for SE7 - what the next goal will be until we decide project is 'stable' - e.g. 20 bugs opened per SE7.\n\n3. Outages or defects (346K ARR impact)\n\nMigration to Elevate (> $90K ARR impact)\n\n4. Product components not imported"
