I understand your confidence in recovering the gap, but this is not going according to plan.\nBen New - 5:44 PM, Jun 3 (EEST)\nIt's going to plan. 51% was last week, it's 61% now, at 9 weeks from 13 (69%). So we're a little behind on actual progress. But the trajectory is 43% over 4 weeks. There was always a front-loading on this work, where we would make little progress at the start.\n1 reaction (Dragos Nuta)\nDragos Nuta - 8:32 PM, Jun 3 (EEST)\nMarked as resolved\nBen New - 7:25 AM, Jun 4 (EEST) New\nI added something about this to the update, and also changed what I wrote about Jive Anywhere because that is done-done now :-)\nRe-opened\nBen New - 7:25 AM, Jun 4 (EEST) New\nMarked as resolved"
