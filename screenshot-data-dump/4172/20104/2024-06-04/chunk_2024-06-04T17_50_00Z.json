    "During the captured timeframe, the user was primarily engaged with Google Chrome. The screenshots show three separate Chrome windows, with one actively displaying the user's email on mail.google.com. The other two windows were on calendar.google.com, likely indicating the user was managing their schedule or checking calendar events. The taskbar at the bottom of the screen shows icons for various applications, but only Chrome was actively used during this period.",
    "The detailed analysis of the screenshots reveals that the user was viewing their email in one of the Chrome windows. The profile picture visible in the top right corner of the email window suggests that the user was logged into their email account. The other two Chrome windows, both on calendar.google.com, displayed icons with the number 4, possibly indicating notifications or upcoming events. This suggests that the user was likely planning or reviewing their schedule while also keeping an eye on their email."
