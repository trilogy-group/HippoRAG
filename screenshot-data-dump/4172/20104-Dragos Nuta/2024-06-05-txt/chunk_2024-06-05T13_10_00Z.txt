By harvesting insights from codebases and integrating them into concise context packs, we can significantly enhance the understanding and decision-making capabilities of our existing tools.\n\nThis \"second brain\" methodology represents a major breakthrough in our Applied AI efforts. It directly addresses the key challenge of providing AI with the rich, relevant context needed to deliver accurate and actionable insights. By focusing on legacy codebases at first, we can refine our techniques and demonstrate the tangible impact on Mini Spec delivery.\n\nAs we scale this approach to more products, including acquired codebases, we anticipate a transformative effect on delivery."
