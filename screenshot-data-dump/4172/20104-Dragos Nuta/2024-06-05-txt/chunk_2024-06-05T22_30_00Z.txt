Dragos's primary concern is that all targeting affects work as OR instead of AND, making it difficult to access high combination targeting factors. However, as this is how X ads work, we don't have any other options to enforce AND across the targeting facets. However, we can still send the right signals if we find the optimal combination that may work like the AND functionality, but this is still unlikely to work as another ad platform like Facebook & LinkedIn.\nGiven that Crossover has very poor brand visibility on X with no or little followers, Dragos thinks we should push Content strategies to create brand awareness, Thought leadership drives increase followers that is going to be searchable on Crossover/Jobs advertisements. The content must be useful ( how to type content) not only the tale of remote workers life or just the benefits etc.\nDragos also wants to push X's job post by boosting it to the right audiences.\nThe team think we should pursue retargeting on X who previously engaged with the Jobs irrespective of platforms they used. Also lookalike campaign for those follows the competitors.\nNew Campaign type : I found a new campaign type called \"Keywords Campaign\" which is based off high intent keywords and the demographic targeting option. This is different than what's happening in the world, other campaign type as when people want to connect with Keywords targeting option in they come to X. Now, advertisers can reach valuable audiences by using specific keywords that place their ads within real-time search results and contextually relevant conversations.
