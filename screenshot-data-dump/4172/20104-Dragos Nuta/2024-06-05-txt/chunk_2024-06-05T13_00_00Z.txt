I will schedule the call.\n\nMy view: We transitioned TPM/ENG to a continuous, weekly delivery model focused on business goals, not internal metrics. Our business goal and maintenance delivery improved from Q1 to Q2 but still need to increase our delivery by a lot to run our businesses successfully and grow. Quality improvement remains a challenge, and I could not improve SaaS at all. Our AI transformation is slow, and I need to reset my second brain work to focus on the problems that I actually want to fix (fixing up legacy codebases, version upgrades, bug fixes, etc)."
