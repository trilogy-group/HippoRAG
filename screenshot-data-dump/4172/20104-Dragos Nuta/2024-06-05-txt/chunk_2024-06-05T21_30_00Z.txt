I am not interested in signing a 12-month (moreover 24-month) contract. Let's get work done, prove business value, and then we can have a yearly contract. All I have for now is two sales calls...\n2. With so many responsibilities on our side, where's your responsibility to hit the CPA and CPOA targets?\n3. I really don't know what those 3 products are or what I am buying. I am not even sure I want to buy those 3 things.\n\nMy ask is to focus on proving your technology, and then we can discuss bundles and yearly contracts. This is not a media spend program.\n\nDragos"
