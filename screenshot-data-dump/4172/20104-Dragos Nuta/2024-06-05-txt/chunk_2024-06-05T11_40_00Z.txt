We should have contacted all customers to increase the size of the early adoption pool.\n - Long upgrade cycles for hosted projects (Messenger, live HOP) make it impossible to demonstrate customer value during the quarter.\n\n- Improvements: we are fixing this by defining the service\n - TPM Slot - Early Adoption Service.\n\n- ITDs:\n - Limit the scope to one process (e.g., not upgrading security)\n - Start by reaching out to ALL customers, increases the fear or the old plans (depending on stage)\n - Start by reaching out broadly to all projects in partnership that were put value from the feature\n - Focus on the pool of early adopters that respond positively and make that list clear to the BU\n - All other customers are in BU's responsibility\n\n- Other topics\n - Cost reduction: completed a long level cost reduction analysis, focused on lower-complexity changes\n - Discount programs: working with AWS to activate MAP, targeting up to ~50% savings per year. EDP and waste pricing sliding discount programs are in good shape.\n - Private: work to prove $200k+ of wasted reservations on eu-north-1. The remaining waste found was either resolved or known by the SaaS Ops Cost team.\n - Reservation and CS (escalation): We have an additional ~100k cost reduction opportunities that will require minor spends for inventory; RDS optimization, centralization, and reservations.\n - Independently, VITransit has made a number of product-level recommendations: these will have to be reviewed by PPS to establish ROI and then handed through mini specs.\n - Providing updates during renewal: TPM will provide content to Renewals that talks about product investments which will be made available to customers during the renewal process\n\n- AI Feature Usage:\n - Link: https://ai-feature-adoption-dash.s3.amazonaws.com"
