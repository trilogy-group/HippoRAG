We have already delivered 88% of our Q2 orders (goal: 20 tickets per SE7), and we are on track to clear all BUs.\n\u2022 We removed 62% of our backlog in Q2 so far and are on track to eliminate our backlog in Q2.\n\u2022 You can find the delivery scorecard and the burndown charts at the bottom of the document.\n\n\u2014 Early Customer Adoption\n\u2022 The PM service was added in May to 3 slots. We made progress, but results are below what we would have wanted and usage/activity remains low:\n\u2022 Messenger: of 20 customers, 4 customers showed interest, none has concrete upgrade plans (many want to wait until the new version is proven stable or are mid-upgrade with older versions)\n\u2022 Jive Security: of 12 customers, 3 are interested in upgrading\n\u2022 Jive Cloud AI: Copilot: 2 customers actively using it, 7 have it enabled, others have it disabled\n\n\u2014 What went well:\n\u2022 Focus on customer problems - conducted calls to understand their problems (for projects in early stages), help them use the product (for AI features), or get them to upgrade (for defense projects)\n\u2022 Focus on business value: analyzing usage (e.g., Jive Copilot Usage Report) and acting upon it\n\n\u2014 What did not go well:\n\u2022 We started without a clear framework and spent a time aligning expectations, navigating our org, or doing work that we did actually believe to be in our scope\n\u2022 We focused on a subset of customers which we believed to be more interested and got low response rates. We should have contacted all customers to increase the size of the early adoption pool. Longer upgrade cycles for the project (Messenger, Jive HQ) make it impossible to demonstrate consumable value during hosted projects.\n\n\u2014 Other topics\n\u2022 Cost reduction: completed a top level cost reduction analysis, focused on lower-complexity changes\n\u2022 Discount programs: working with AWS to reactivate MAP, targeting up to ~500K savings per year. EDP and private pricing discount programs are in good shape.\n\u2022 Waste: working to solve 20% of wasted resources on our-next-hour-1. The remaining waste found during private review sessions are considered manageable."
