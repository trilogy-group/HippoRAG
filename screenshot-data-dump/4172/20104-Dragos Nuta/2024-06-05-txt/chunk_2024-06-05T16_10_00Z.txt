We have released a version that will enable that upgrade.\nNow, we have covered $11M out of $12M planned ARR customers, but we still hold off (10) of high ARR customers who requested the changes and are not in our customers reach yet to the upgrade. Only 4/20 (b1) also asked for 0.2. We will are very slow to entire customer base but, most importantly, we are pushing them to provide the necessary licenses and information for the upgrade.\nRisk: SoftwareAG must provide installation and use case instructions to end users and tools and test the upgrade. This step is impossible to avoid as we build for the future. Action: We are pushing them to provide the necessary licenses and information for the upgrade.\nMessenger is now simply adding the 02 objective as we are well delivered on the infrastructure and providing supported solutions. We are derisking our architecture will cope with Java 17 changes or if we need to redesign the architecture.\n"
