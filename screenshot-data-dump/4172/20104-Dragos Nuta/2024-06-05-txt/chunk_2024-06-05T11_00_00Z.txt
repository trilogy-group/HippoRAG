Time sensitivity of decisions can also elevate urgency.\nInputs: A clear problem statement or decision needed, the specific unknowns, and recommended technical exploration activities. Guidance on what success looks like - deliverables, metrics, etc. Background context and pointers to related efforts.\nJudging quality: Quality is based on whether the technical activities resulted in useful learnings that now enable better-informed decisions. This could mean positive results or failures, as long as the outcome yields tangible insights. Evidence that assumptions were validated/invalidated.\n\nInput DS\n\nImportant: share the document with all of ESW and tibbroadcast@trilogy.com with edit rights\n\nBackground\nTPM has developed a mini-spec writer that accepts a second brain and context packs as input documents and through iterative chat with an AI agent produces mini-spec documents in markdown. We have used this for both standard kanban work and for more specific use cases related to acquisition (pre-IQ, due diligence).\nProblem Statement\nAll of TPM has been using this in various ways, but so far we have all been using the product locally. To both streamline how we use the product, and allow other teams to experiment with our tool, we want to deploy this tool to our AWS TPM account.\nImportance\nPublishing our work saves us time in using the product and also helps other teams use and likely improve our tool with targeted feedback. Our long-term goal here is to be AI-first in all of our regular \u201cwork units\u201d, and publishing our tools helps us get there.\nScope Exclusions\n\u2022 Alerting - TPM can configure alarms as needed\nContext References\n\u2022 https://github.com/trilogy-group/tpm-mini-spec-wr Stratifyd Second Brain - example 2nd brain used as input to help generate specs 162174280605 - TPM AWS account where the mini spec writer should be deployed\nKey Unknowns\nNone - this should be a standard AWS deployment using Docker\nActivities\n\u2022 Confirm the product can be built from main\n\u2022 Deploy the app to AWS\n\u2022 Ensure that any changes to the main branch auto-deploy to the AWS app\nSuccess Criteria\n\u2022 Application loads as expected with minimal latency\nDeliverables\n\u2022 Mini spec writer is running on an accessible url\nEvaluation\n\u2022 Application runs as expected without any issues"
