By harvesting insights from codebases and turning them into concise context packs, we can significantly enhance the understanding and decision-making capabilities of our existing tools.\n\nThis 'second brain' methodology represents a major breakthrough in our Applied AI efforts. It directly addresses the key challenge of providing AI with the rich, relevant context needed to deliver accurate and actionable insights. By focusing on legacy codebases first, we can refine our techniques and demonstrate the tangible impact on Mini Spec delivery.\n\nAs we scale this approach to more products, including acquired codebases, we anticipate a transformative effect on development productivity. Developers and TPMs equipped with context-enhanced AI tools will be empowered to make better decisions, write higher-quality code, and navigate complex codebases with unprecedented efficiency.\n\nWhile there are challenges ahead in fully realizing this vision, the path is clear. By systematically building out 'second brains' and deeply integrating them into our AI ecosystem, we have the opportunity to achieve extraordinary gains in Mini Spec delivery and set a new standard for AI-assisted development.\n\nMaintenance Delivery Scorecard (using Eng issue)\nBU\tMaint Goals (20 per SE7)\tMaint Delivery (EO May)\tProgress\tBacklog Start\tBacklog EO May\tImprovement\nCopperTree\t60\t52\t87%\t44\t13"
