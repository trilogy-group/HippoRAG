Most of our products we are working on (feature or maintenance) are now releasing weekly. Only a few products, like CloudCharging, have reached daily releases. We still have a long way to go here too.\n\nReleases\nFor maintenance, our order is to deliver 20 maintenance tickets per SE7 in a quarter. In Q1, we delivered 70% of these orders. In Q2, we set more aggressive goals to eliminate the backlog.\nBy May, we had already delivered 88% of the SE7 goals for the quarter. We have cut 62% of our backlog this quarter and expect to reduce it to only one week's worth of incoming tickets.\nMy strategy for tackling the backlog age is unchanged: eliminate the backlog completely, bringing the age down to one week. We plan to achieve this in June."

Our business goal and maintenance delivery improved from Q1 to Q2 but still need to increase our delivery by a lot to run our businesses successfully and grow. Quality improvement remains a challenge, and I could not improve SaaS at all. Our AI transformation is slow, and I need to rest my second brain work to focus on the problems that I actually want to fix (fixing up legacy codebases, version upgrades, bug fixes, cost optimisations and adding ai features - all with AI).\n\nHere are some data points we can look at..."
