We made progress, but results are below what we would have wanted and usage/activity remains low:\nMessenger: of 20 customers, 4 customers showed interest, none has concrete upgrade plans (many want to wait until the new version is proven stable)\nJive Security: of 12 customers, 3 are interested in upgrading.\nJive Cloud AI Copilot: 2 customers actively using it, 7 have it enabled, most have it disabled\n\nWhat went well:\nFocus on customer problems - conducted calls to understand their problems (for projects in early stages), help them use the product (for AI features), or get them to upgrade (for defense projects)\nFocus on business value: analyzing usage (e.g., Jive Copilot Usage Report) and acting upon it\n\nWhat did not go well:\nWe started without a clear framework and spent time aligning expectations, navigating our org, or doing work that we did actually believe to be in our advantage."

We have released a version that will enable that upgrade.\n\nNow, we have covered $11M out of $12M planned ARR customers, but we are seeing low adoption:\nHalf (10) of high ARR customers who requested the changes answered our request for deployment plans\nOur customers are very slow to upgrade. Only 4/20 ($1.6M) asked for the new version but don't plan upgrading in Q2. We will reach out to the entire customer base but, most likely, no customers will upgrade within Q2.\n\nRisk: SoftwareAG must provide installation and use case instructions to enable us to prepare the environment and tools and test the upgrade. This step is impossible to avoid as we build software that connects with third-party tools. Action: We are pushing them to provide the necessary licenses and information to unblock this activity.\n\nWe expect to deliver it the first week of June.\n\nWe continue simplifying the deliverables while maintaining the business objective. This enabled us to overdeliver and extend the number of business objectives this quarter for the second month in a row.\n\nWe must provide all improvements done in the products to the Renewals team so they can start the discussion based on these deliverables."
