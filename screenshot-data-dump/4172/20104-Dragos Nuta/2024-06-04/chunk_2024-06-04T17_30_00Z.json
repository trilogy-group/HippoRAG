The inbox contains various emails related to project updates, budget notes, AI tools, and other work-related communications. The user is likely prioritizing and organizing their tasks based on the emails received. The presence of multiple VIP emails and starred messages indicates that the user is focusing on important communications that require immediate attention.",

The content in Notepad shows a simple calculation related to media spend, which might be part of the financial analysis or project planning discussed in the Google Sheets document.
