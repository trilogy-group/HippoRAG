The goal is to get the product enhancements in the hands of engaged early adopter customers.\n\nApproach\n\nWhat is in the scope of the PM early adoption service\n\nEarly Involvement: PMs get involved in the early stages of the project to deeply understand the customer problem and validate the solution.\nSelecting Early Adopters: For each slot, the PMs will reach out broadly to the entire applicable customer base and identify the willing early adopters who want to engage.\nContinuous Engagement: As the feature is being built and released in small iterations, PMs will work with selected customers and collect customer feedback that will guide the implementation. They will ensure that customers are successful in using the new features/updates and demonstrate the business value delivered by the slot.\nImproving Outreach: Over time, PMs will improve their outreach, playbook and techniques to convert more of the overall customer base into engaged early adopters. However, their scope will remain limited to customers who willingly opt-in to participate.\n\nWhat is out of scope\n\nDriving adoption from the remaining unengaged customers. The PMs will provide a clear list of which subset of customers they are focused on so there is no ambiguity about the split of responsibilities with the BU.\nDefense projects - security upgrades or certifications do not need an early adoption service, just proper announcements and coordination of the install (e.g., distributing binaries for on-prem or install/release for SaaS products)\nRelease process coordination - e.g., distributing binaries for on-prem or install/release for SaaS products, paperwork, marketing announcements, project managing the various involved parties (CS, Eng, BU, customer), etc\n\nService prerequisites\n\nAutonomy: PMs need the autonomy to contact and work with customers but all communication plans and messaging will be shared for review with BUs. Throughout the project, they will position their work as focused on the slot business goal, to avoid any confusion with the responsibility of the BU PMs or CSMs.\nCustomer Contacts: BUs will provide the customer list and known contacts. In addition, PMs will attempt to navigate the organization or use available information to identify the most relevant stakeholders.\n\nProcess\n\nTo ensure the successful early adoption of AI features and enhancements, the AI Adoption Product Manager (PM) service will follow structured and methodical approaches to engage the right stakeholders and ensure that the AI solutions are effectively integrated into the customer's operational processes."
