We have already delivered 88% of our Q2 orders (goal: 20 tickets) and we are on track to overhaul for all BUs.\nWe removed 62% of our backlog in Q2 so far and are on track to eliminate our backlog in Q2.\nYou can find the delivery scorecard and the burndown charts at the bottom of the document.\n\nEarly Customer Adoption\nPMs hired in April were assigned to 3 BUs (Ignite, Jigsaw, Influitive). We made progress, but results what we would have wanted and usage/activity remains low:\nMessenger: of 20 customers, 4 customers showed interest, none has concrete upgrade plans yet to wait until the new version is proven stable\nWe want to cut the number down is a problem in itself\nJive Cloud AI Copilot: 2 customers are actively using it, 7 have it enabled, most have it disabled\nInfluitive AI Feature: 2 customers started recently, 7\n\nImprovements\nWe are fixing this by defining the service\nTPM Slot - Early Adoption Service\nOther topics"
