    "The user was primarily engaged with the 'LockApp' during the recorded period. The screenshots captured at 17:22:30Z, 17:25:04Z, and 17:28:20Z all show a completely black screen, indicating that the system was either turned off, experiencing a crash, or in a locked state. No visible UI elements, text, or icons were present in any of the screenshots, suggesting no active user interaction with the system during this time frame.",
    "The detailed analysis of the screenshots confirms that the 'Default Lock Screen' was the only application active. The lock screen was in full-screen mode and remained active throughout the captured period. The absence of any visible content or text further supports the conclusion that the system was either locked or experiencing a display issue. No other applications or activities were detected during this period."
