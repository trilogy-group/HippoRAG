We can revise-resupply html if any design tweaks are needed (e.g. if you can't port the company logos and/or 'metadata chip' values via the SFP API, we could remove those fields from v1 and troubleshoot for v2... but it might look bad if they were removed without adjusting the job card layout).\nLastly:\n1. When it's ready to start deploying, please send test mails to me and vinodh@zamstars.com, ideally with real data, so we double check the variable fields and clickthru URLs etc.\n2. I assume the adjustments to trigger criteria have been made. Please let me know if anything had to deviate away from what I outlined in my earliest comments on this ticket.\n3. Thank you for updating the GenAI prompts after my last feedback. This meets my MVP Q8 now, so doesn't have to be a blocker for v1, but there's still room for improvement."
