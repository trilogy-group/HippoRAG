Personalization: Use the recipient's name and tailor the content.\n3. Concise Content: Keep emails short and to the point.\n4. Call to Action: Clearly state what you want the recipient to do.\n5. Professional Tone: Maintain a professional and respectful tone.\n\nShare specific templates for detailed feedback.\n\nHope this helps!"
