For example, if a customer is switching CRM platforms will need to: migrate contact, account and activity data, rebuild important workflows and automations, train the sales team, etc.\n2) The indirect cost associated with the risk that the switch represents. For example, if the transition date to a new CRM is missed, there is a potential result that Sales reps cannot do their core job. That would have a monetary impact on revenue.\n\nConsidering direct cost is straightforward. In order to consider indirect cost, try to capture the specific risks if a switch does not go smoothly.\n\nCalculations based on customers matching the ICP (any company with 10k employees).\n- Market research cohort: $120k (avg ARR $400k)\n- Communicate XI cohort: $200k (avg ARR $700k)\n- Employee Experience cohort: $200k (avg ARR $995k)\n- Customer Experience cohort: $55k (avg ARR $455k)\n\nMarket Research\nItem\tOne sentence Description\t$ Figure\tRationale for $ Figure (the math)\nRebuild surveys\tLong complex surveys with lots of branching, piping would need to be rebuilt without losing data integrity.\t$50k\t4 weeks for 5-10 people\nEmployee training\tA market research agency will presumably have many users that live in the tool every day.\t$60k\t250 people (2.5% of company) require 4 hours of training on average\nRisk of downtime\t$8k per hour\t- $0k - 1000k responses per day = $4000 per hour\n- $.50 - $2 per response = $8,000 per hour in lost revenue\n\nCommunicate XI\nItem\tOne sentence Description\t$ Figure\tRationale for $ Figure (the math)\nExport / import content\tExport content.
