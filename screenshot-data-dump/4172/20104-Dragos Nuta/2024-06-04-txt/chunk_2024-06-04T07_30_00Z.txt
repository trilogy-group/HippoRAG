Most of you have 1 screenshot per 10 minutes, with some having 3 per 10 minutes.\n- How It Works: Your screenshots are converted into text and utilized in an RAG pipeline that employs HyDE.\n- Data Coverage: For most users, AI Assist has the last 2-3 weeks of data. If you just added your business email to WorkSmart, it will only start accumulating now.\n- Model Options: You can switch it to use GPT-4 or Claude3.\n- Limitation: Currently, it does not maintain session history. Each request is handled independently, without connecting to the previous chat history.\n- Lag: It takes a few minutes for the latest screenshots to be sent to the backend and indexed. Give it 10-15 minutes.\n\nShare Your Feedback!\nMichael and I would love to hear about your experience using AI Assist! Whether it did things right, messed something up, or if there are features you'd like to see, we want to hear it all.\n\nThank..."
