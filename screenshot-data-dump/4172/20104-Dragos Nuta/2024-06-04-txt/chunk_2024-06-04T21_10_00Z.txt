Can we detect boundaries of logical content (eg. document X, chat with Y, summary about Z from page A)\n2. Can we stitch content together? How well can we do it (it does not have to be perfect)?\n3. Can we avoid having the UX mix up content (eg. know that a comment in JIRA is made by X, or that message on chat from Z is from a certain date)\n\nActivities\n- Test with different types of inputs\n * Every 3 minute screenshots\n * Every 1 minute screenshots\n * Every 30 seconds screenshots\n * Videos of every 5 second segments\n- Test different LLMs and screening techniques\n- Evaluate if the content can be extracted into logical documents and whether the quality of the content in each logical document is generally right (we want to be able to understand it to some extent, not to have a perfect copy, nor to catch every little detail)\n\nSuccess Criteria\n[What does an acceptable vs. great outcome look like? Will love evaluative quality. Be specific on the metrics you will be looking for, aspects that the answer you touch]"
