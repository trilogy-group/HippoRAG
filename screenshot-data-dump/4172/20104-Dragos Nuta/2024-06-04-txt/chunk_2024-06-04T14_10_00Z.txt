The goal is to get the product enhancements in the hands of engaged early adopter customers.\n\nApproach\nWhat is in the scope of the PM early adoption service\n- Early Involvement: PMs get involved in the early stages of the project to deeply understand the customer problem and validate the solution.\n- Selecting Early Adopters: For each slot, the PMs will reach out broadly to the entire applicable customer base and identify the willing early adopters who want to engage.\n- Continuous Engagement: As the feature is being built and released in small iterations, PMs will work with selected customers and collect customer feedback that will guide the implementation. They will ensure that customers are successful in using the new features/updates and demonstrate the business value delivered by the slot.\n- Improving Outreach: Over time, PMs will improve their outreach, playbook and techniques to convert more of the overall customer base into engaged early adopters. However, their scope will remain limited to customers who willingly opt-in to participate.\n\nWhat is out of scope\n- Driving adoption from the remaining unengaged customers. The PMs will provide a clear list of which subset of customers they are focused on so there is no ambiguity about the split of responsibilities with the BU.\n- Defense projects - security upgrades or certifications do not need an early adoption service, just proper announcements and coordination of the install (e.g., distributing binaries for on-prem or install/release for SaaS products)\n- Release process coordination - e.g., distributing binaries for on-prem or install/release for SaaS products, paperwork, marketing announcements, project managing the work of various involved parties (CS, Eng, BU, customer), etc\n\nService prerequisites\n- Autonomy: PMs need the autonomy to contact and work with customers but all communications plans and messaging will be shared for review with BUs. Throughout the project, they will position their work as focused on the slot business goal, to avoid any confusion with the responsibility of the BU PMs or CSMs.\n- Customer Contacts: BUs will provide the customer list and known contacts. In addition, PMs will attempt to navigate the organization or use available information to identify the most relevant stakeholders.\n\nProcess\nTo ensure the successful early adoption of AI features and enhancements, the AI Adoption Product Manager (PM) service will follow structured approaches to ensure that the AI Adoption Product Manager (PM) service will"

We should have contacted all customers to increase the size of the early adoption pool. Long upgrade cycles for hosted projects (Messenger, Jive HOP) make it impossible to demonstrate customer value during the quarter.\nImprovements: we are fixing this by defining the service TPM Slot - Early Adoption Service.\n\nOther topics\nCost reduction: we did a top level analysis on cost reduction opportunities, focused on low-complexity quick high level overview of cost reduction potential, focusing on global potentials:\nDiscount programs: discounting of AWS to reactivate MAP, targeting up to ~50% savings per year. EDP and private pricing was work with programs in good shape.\nWaste: working to solve 20% waste as reservation and consumption reduction opportunities that will require mini specs (ES reservation; RDs optimization, centralization, and reservations).\nVitrasant cost reduction: these all require product changes; will have to be reviewed by TPM and handled through mini specs.\n\nProviding updates during renewal: TPM will provide content to Renewals that talks about product investments which will be made available to customers during the renewal process"
