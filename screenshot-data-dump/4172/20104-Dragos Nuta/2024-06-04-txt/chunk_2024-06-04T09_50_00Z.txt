Delays in handling legacy backlog ($578k ARR impact)\n\nThe focus during the first quarter was to complete the import and reduce cost; maintenance was not a priority. Furthermore, the decision was to not import the maintenance backlog and instead work through the issues as customers escalate them. This backfired as some of the ongoing issues were high severity ones and led to an ~$900k ARR churn.\n\nExamples:\n- AWS Case: AWS, the largest single customer loss ($700k), cited a breach due to an outstanding security ticket, identified before the acquisition. The issue was raised in Nov 2023, we became aware of it early Q1 but decided to fix it after completing the import & cost reduction.\n- There was another severity 1 issue that was incompletely fixed by the legacy team, and that we fixed during Q1.\n- There was set of already paid for but not delivered work (features) - supposed to be done by PS but some of those were Engineering\n- LinkedIn app was not working for more than a year due to outdated APIs\n- The import was completed by Jan 17 for PostBeyond and Jan 19 for AdvocateHub but maintenance started later\n\nImmediate Next Steps:\n- Continue working through the maintenance backlog; estimating to go to zero by EqQ2\n\nProcess improvements:\n- All outstanding issues MUST be reviewed by BU/TPM/Eng and a clear decision taken on what to migrate over to our internal bug ticketing system, along with any promised dates that were communicated to the customer.\n- All bug fixes implemented by the legacy team post acquisition MUST be owned and verified by our Engineering team, we cannot blindly rely on legacy team's deliveries.\n- Start the maintenance work in the first quarter and factor this into the performance plan (cost and timeline-wise).\n- We should combine maintenance and slot teams until we reduce the backlog to manageable levels e.g. 1-2 quarters - this will allow everyone to focus on what is really important vs thinking in what bucket to put it\n- If there is low number of bugs - this will help with the backlog or missing features\n- If there are plenty of bugs - this will help reducing specs or missing features\n- We need to define acceptable backlog by SE7 - that we need to go to until we decide product is \"stable\" - e.g. 20 bugs open per SE7\n\n2. Outages or defects (346k ARR impact, half from one customer - Broadcom)\n\nFacts and Examples:\n- We missed collecting credentials for a number of dependencies and this led to various issues\n- e.g., Facebook, Receptacha (assumed an outage when a GCP account that was not part of PI was turned off), etc."
