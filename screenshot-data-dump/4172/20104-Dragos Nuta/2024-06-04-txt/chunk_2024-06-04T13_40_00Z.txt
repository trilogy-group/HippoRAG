We have already delivered 88% of our Q2 orders (goal: 20 tickets per SE7), and we are on track to overdeliver for all BUs.\nWe removed 62% of our backlog in Q2 so far and are on track to eliminate our backlog in Q2.\n\nYou can find the delivery scorecard and the burndown charts at the bottom of the document.\n\nEarly Customer Adoption\nPMs hired in April were assigned to 3 BUs (Ignite, Jigsaw, Influitive). We made progress, but results are below what we would have wanted and usage/activity remains low.\n\nMessage: of 20 customers, 4 customers showed interest, none has concrete upgrade plans (many want to wait until the new version is proven stable or are mid-upgrade with older versions)\nJive Cloud AI Copilot: 2 customers actively using it, 7 have it enabled, most have it disabled\n\nWhat went well:\nFocus on customer problems - conducted calls to understand their problems (for projects in early stages), help them use the product (for AI features), or get them to upgrade (for defense projects)\nFocus on business value: analyzing usage (e.g. Jive Copilot Usage Report) and acting upon it"
