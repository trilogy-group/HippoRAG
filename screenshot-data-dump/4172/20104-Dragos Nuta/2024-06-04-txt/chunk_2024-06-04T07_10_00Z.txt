Move to Central compute\n2. Keep the compute as-is\nReasoning\nWe want to keep the import simple, and use a follow-up spec to initiate the move of the database to Central resources.\nP2 Feedback\nNone\n\nThe Problem\nShould we move the database to Central?\nOptions Considered (Decision in bold)\n1. Move to Central DB\n2. Keep the database as-is\nReasoning\nMoving to Central DB would require:\n- Name changes\n- Version compatibility\nWe want to keep the import simple, and use a follow-up spec to initiate the move of the database to Central DB.\nP2 Feedback\nNone\n\nSystems Access\nWhat is important to engineering? What infrastructure needs to be migrated to AWS?\nBackground\nThe infrastructure is already on AWS. There are 4 AWS accounts in total. The import would move the AWS accounts into VDI.\nOnce federated under VDI, we should make sure we are tagging these resources so they are eligible for MAP credits, which can be as significant as 25-50% savings depending on the AWS service.\n\nITD 3 - Coordinate KT sessions ASAP with a focus on data ingestion and ML models\nThe Problem\nHow should KT sessions be conducted?\nOptions Considered\n1. Do broad comprehensive KT sessions\n2. Coordinate KT sessions ASAP with a focus on data ingestion and ML models\nReasoning\nMost build and CI/CD processes are well-documented on the wiki. Rather than execute a broad set of KT sessions, we should derisk the import by focusing on the riskiest aspects of the platform, namely the data ingestion and ML model operation.\nP2 Feedback\nNone"
