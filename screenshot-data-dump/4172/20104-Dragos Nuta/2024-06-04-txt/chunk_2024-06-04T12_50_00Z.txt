Instead of completing a DS file and submitting a JIRA ticket, please direct new vendors to fill out this Google Form. Please ask them to ensure that they enter their data accurately and completely and add yourself in the field \"Email address of your ESW Contact\". The form is directly linked to NetSuite, facilitating a more efficient vendor enrollment process.\n\nOnce a vendor is added in NetSuite, a confirmation email will be sent to both you and the vendor. Please review the confirmation email carefully.\n\nVendor Bill Processing\n\nWe have an automation in place to read and post vendor bills. For the automation to pick up the invoice, please ensure that the invoice is sent to ap.scanandcapture@trilogy.com, with a file explicitly containing the PO within the document.\n\nVendor Queries\n\nWe have disabled manually creating a Jira ticket in the finance queue for this work unit. As was the case previously, please send all queries to the accounts payable mailbox and this will be handled by Central Support.\n\nAny issues, questions and blockers, please let me know.\n\nRegards,\n\n--\nMilo Mier\nFinance Manager\nESW / Trilogy\nEmail: ludel.mier@trilogy.com\nPhone: +63 917 519 1409\nTime zone: GMT +8"

We have already delivered 88% of our Q2 orders (goal: 20 tickets per SE7), and we are on track to overdeliver for all BUs.\nWe removed 62% of our backlog in Q2 so far and are on track to eliminate our backlog in Q2.\nOur backlog goal will go down when we remove our backlog.\nYou can find the delivery scorecard and the burndown charts at the bottom of the document.\n\nEarly Customer Adoption\nPMs hired in April were assigned to 3 BUs (Ignite, Jigsaw, Influitive). We made progress, but results are below what we would have wanted and usage/activity remains low:\nMessenger: of 20 customers, 4 customers showed interest, none has concrete upgrade plans (many went to wait until the new version is proven stable or are mid-upgrade with older versions)\nJive unit of Influitive: 20 customers are interested in upgrading.\nJive Cloud AI Copilot: 2 customers actively using it, 7 have it enabled, most have it disabled\nInfluitive AI feature: outreach started recently\n\nWhat went well:\nFocus on customer problems - conducted calls to understand their problems (for projects in early stages), help them use the product (for AI features), or get them to upgrade (for defense projects)\nFocus on business value: analyzing usage (e.g. Jive Copilot Usage Report ) and acting upon it\nWhat did not go well:\nWe started without a clear framework and spent a time aligning expectations, navigating our org, or doing work that we did actually believe to be in our scope\nWe focused on a subset of customers which we believed to be more interested and got low response rates. We should have contacted all customers to increase the size of the early adoption pool."
