To look into this deeper, we will first enable AWS RUM monitoring on the client side: LAMBDA-6702\nOther options considered:\nChange the set password screen to be more welcoming and have a clearer intent\nSet up monitoring on email opens and clicks to understand the drop rate\nSend password over email and automatically log in the candidate\nReducing the number of BFQ reminders led to a drop in BFQ takers of 2%\nNote: The reasoning for this change is in the third document \ud83d\udcc4 Purchase Super Messages for SF Marketing Cloud\nPlan: none, the decision is still sound in terms of cost/benefit/impact\nAdding standard BFQs as a step before taking the BFQ led to a drop in BFQ completion of 2%\nNote: this was done at the time in an attempt to enrich the data we have for Prime customers.\nPlan: The change was undone on Oct 5, 2023 through LAMBDA-6576 and the negative effect should now be undone\nVariations that seem unrelated to any change\nSevere 2x drop on the percent of candidates that took the BFQ between 1 to 11 days\nIt may be related to the email that LinkedIn sent is sending, although unfortunately we have no information on when that email was introduced\nPlan: Dragos Nuta to define a task that keeps LinkedIn ads open for another 4 weeks or more\nDrop from 2.5% to under 1% for the percent of candidates that take the BFQ between days 5 and 11\nIt happened at the same time with switching to Cognito, but does not seem logical related, nor is it offsetted by a different segment.\nPlan: None. The change is small so we will not investigate further at this time\nA consistent month-over-month drop of ~1% in the percentage of candidates that take the BFQ in the first 24h from applying\nIt started with the switch to Cognito but instead of having a sudden drop and a plateau, we are seeing a constant drop month over month\nOne hypothesis is that it is a reflection of all changes - each change has worsened things a bit, and as changes were made, the overall impact was more negative than expected."
