We have already delivered 88% of our Q2 orders (goal was 100%)\nWe removed 62% of our backlog in Q2 so far and are on track to eliminate our backlog.\nOur backlog goal will go down when we remove our backlog.\nYou can find the delivery scorecard and the burndown charts at the bottom of the document\n\nEarly Customer Adoption\nPMs hired in April were assigned to 3 BUs (Ignite, Jigsaw, Influitive). We made progress but customer adoption remains low:\nWe sent out 20 customers, 4 customers showed interest, none has converted to a sale yet.\nMajority of until now the new version is proven stable or are mid-upgrade with us.\n\nWhat went well:\nWe focused on customer problems - conducted calls to understand their problems (focus on business value, product fit for features), get them to upgrade (for defense projects)\nStages, help them use the analyzing (use AI e.g. [Live or Copilot Usage Report]) and acting upon it\nWhat did not go well:\nWe started without a clear framework and spent a time aligning expectations, navigating our org, or doing work that we did actually believe to be in our scope\nWe focused on a subset of customers which we believed to be more interested and got low response rates. We should have contacted all customers to increase the size of the early adoption pool."
