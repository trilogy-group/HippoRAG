I'm at his disposal if he needs anything.\n\nReading Critters\nWork Completed:\n- Remaining two tasks for Lesson 23 implemented. Lesson 23 now complete and live in TestFlight v0.1 (12).\n- Handwriting recognition was tricky, but should be OK now. Uses two approaches:\n * First, a custom implementation of Dynamic Time Warping (possible patent) compares the written letter to the letter the app writes.\n * Second, if DTW fails, uses onboard text recognition. This is less reliable because it was trained for printed text, but gets it some percentage of the time.\n * If both of these still don't seem good enough, the next option to try is AWS Textract, which is trained on handwriting data.\n- About halfway into using pre-recorded sounds for single phonemes rather than on-the-fly generated speech.\n- Continued to work on improving flow and scripts.\n- Fixed several crashes.\n- Created initial brains and prompts for marketing automation. As I shared, the current results are subpar and would benefit from some work on second brains about what makes for good tweets and blog posts generally.\n * Tweet assistant (in Sandbox)\n * Blog post assistant (in Sandbox org)\n- Our evaluation license for SpeechSuper (used for single phoneme recognition) expired over the weekend, so it's currently broken. I've emailed the developer to set us up with a real license and extend the evaluation license by a week in the meantime.\n\nGoals for This Week:\n- Pre-recorded sounds for individual phonemes\n- Tasks needed for lessons 1-63\n- Add 4 more lessons across that range, bringing the total to 5\n- Home screen with lesson navigator\n- Add animal character and paw\n- Work on tweet assistant\n- Evaluate video tutor created by AndyM's vendors\n\nThanks,\nShawn"
