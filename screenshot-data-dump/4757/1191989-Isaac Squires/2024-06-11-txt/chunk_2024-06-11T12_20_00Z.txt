I'll make this clearer\nSimon Said 3:01AM \u00b7 Edited\nYou\nIt seems like in the document you are comparing Markdown vs Latex, but I don't think that's the decision to compare. I think it would be:\n1. Should we use Latex or MathML?\n2. Should we support Markdown formatting?\n3. Should we use MathJax specific commands (Latex extensions)?\nWe have an ongoing experiment in AI eng to compare Latex with MathML, this should drive us in the right direction.\nITD 2 doesn't compare MD vs Latex, it compares all options we have to generate a combination of formatted text + Math formulae, these being Latex, MathML, MD with Latex extensions, QTI. There's actually a fifth which we'll add - MD with MathML.\n\u2022 the nuance of comparing these directly vs first picking MathML vs Latex is that while MathML is more verbose, MD resolves this concern for text formatting, which may impact the decision.\ndo you see this part differently?"

        "The user is engaged in a chat conversation on Gmail with a colleague named Simon. The discussion revolves around comparing Markdown and Latex for formatting text and MathML for mathematical formulas. The user is clarifying the differences and suggesting the use of MathML over Latex due to its verbosity and better text formatting capabilities. The user also mentions an ongoing experiment in AI engineering to compare Latex with MathML, indicating a focus on making an informed decision based on the experiment's outcomes.",
        "The user has a task list open on the right side of the Gmail interface. The tasks include Q2 progress/Q3 plan, Samy 1:1 topics, weekly update, entering grades, posting content on TikTok, following up with Doreen about a research study, and publishing a game for Xbox/PlayStation/Apple Vision Pro. This indicates that the user is managing multiple tasks and projects simultaneously, likely involving coordination with different team members and stakeholders.",
