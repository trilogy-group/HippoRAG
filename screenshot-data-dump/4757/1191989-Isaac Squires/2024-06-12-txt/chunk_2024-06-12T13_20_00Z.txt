Eng: Team Roster and updated the budget split\n2. That's the cost of running the underlying platform (content gen, learning algorithms, etc)\n3. I'll reduce the design mockup costs to $32K/quarter, so it aligns with ~$125K per quarter we are paying for a $100K comp (including tools like Figma and stuff)\n4. @Simon Said - can you chime in here? I have no visibility on what Mark Forrester is doing\n5. Student Interns I see are under Tristan, so I'd assume it was more marketing-related activities (e.g. video creation).\n6. Good catch - fixed\n\nUpdated\nNo, it doesn't\nThanks!"
