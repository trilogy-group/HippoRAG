The system clock shows '8:32 AM' and the date '12 Jun 2024', confirming the time of the activity.",
        "The in-call messages sidebar in the Google Meet interface shows a link to a Google Sheets document titled 'GT School Q3'24 Budget Details' and another document titled 'TeachTap Marketing Plan - Q3 2024'.
