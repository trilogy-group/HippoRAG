We could work on this next quarter if needed, at some point it's definitely worth taking a look at low hanging fruit too.\nSimon Said Now\nAs I mentioned doing the breakdown is non trivial - I don't know the % of DB usage for content gen vs alpha for example.

The discussion revolves around the cost breakdown of a project, specifically focusing on the database (DB) usage and its cost implications. Simon mentions that breaking down the costs by product is not trivial and suggests that this task could be tackled in the next quarter. The conversation also touches on the primary cost drivers, which include DB CPU usage rather than storage.",
        "The user is also managing tasks using the task management sidebar in Gmail. The tasks listed include various activities such as 'Tablet for Phil's son,' 'Q2 progress / Q3 plan,' 'Samy 1:1 topics,' 'User submitted video,' 'Play test,' 'Enter grade (support US grades only),' 'Post TeachTap content on TikTok,' 'Follow up with Doreen about beta program and research study,' 'Publish game for Xbox / Playstation / Apple vision pro,' and '$299 per grade level.' These tasks indicate a mix of personal, project management, and content creation activities."
