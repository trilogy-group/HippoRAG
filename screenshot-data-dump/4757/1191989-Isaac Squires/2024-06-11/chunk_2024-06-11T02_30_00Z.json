I believe MathJax is just a specific latex to HTML rendering library, and it has several custom latex commands It seems like in the document you are comparing Markdown vs Latex, but I don't think that's the decision to compare. I think it would be: 1. Should we use Latex or MathML? 2. Should we support Markdown formatting? 3. Should we use MathJax specific commands?"

The discussion revolves around standardizing content generation, specifically focusing on the use of MathJax, LaTeX, and Markdown. Simon provides a link to a Notion document for further details and suggests performing a couple of Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to validate some areas. The user is also considering whether to use LaTeX or MathML, support Markdown formatting, or use MathJax-specific commands.",
    "The user has a task management interface open on the side, listing various tasks such as Q2 progress/Q3 plan, Samy 1:1 topics, weekly updates, entering grades, posting TeachTap content on TikTok, and following up with Doreen about a beta program and research study. The tasks also include budget meetings, app testing, and other administrative activities. This indicates that the user is managing multiple projects and responsibilities simultaneously."
