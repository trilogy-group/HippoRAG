  "activitySummary": [
    "The user is actively participating in a Zoom meeting, as indicated by the Zoom Meeting application being open and in fullscreen mode. The meeting involves screen sharing, with Tristan Muniz sharing their screen. The shared screen displays an AppsFlyer dashboard, which is used for analyzing various metrics related to app performance. The dashboard shows different sections such as 'Overview', 'Cohort's Retention', 'Activity', 'Retention', 'Custom Dashboards', 'Pivot', 'Events', 'People-Based Attribution', 'Optimize', 'Engage', 'Collaborate', and 'Export'. The user is likely discussing these metrics with other participants in the meeting, as evidenced by the video thumbnails of Isaac Squires and Tristan Muniz at the top right corner.",
    "The user is also engaged in research activities, as indicated by the presence of a web browser with multiple tabs open. One of the tabs shows a Google search query for 'traction book eos', suggesting that the user is looking for information related to the book 'Traction' by Gino Wickman, which is about the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS). This indicates that the user is likely researching business strategies or methodologies to improve their work or project.",
    "The AppsFlyer dashboard displayed on the shared screen provides detailed metrics such as 'Revenue per user by media source', 'iOS 15 postbacks', 'Clicks', 'Impressions', 'Click-to-install rate', 'Converted users', 'Converted users / Installs', 'Total revenue ($)', 'Total event count', and 'eCPA'. The user is likely analyzing these metrics to understand the performance of different media sources like 'organic', 'tikokglobal_int', 'Google', and 'Facebook Ads'. This analysis could be part of a larger discussion on optimizing app performance and user acquisition strategies."
