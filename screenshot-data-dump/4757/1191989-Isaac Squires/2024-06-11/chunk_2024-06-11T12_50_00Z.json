Acquisition: Cost per download of $2.00 (achieved our goal of $2) with 91% of downloads being our target user (students) who were sitting AP exams in May. We drove >100k downloads.\n2. Activation: 79% of downloads converted to sign ups (exceeded our goal of 60%)\n3. Engagement: 49% of signed-up users completed at least one practice test, with 900 students completing 2.4k practice tests per day, and >9k students completing >22k practice tests in total. Sustained an app store rating of 4.6/5 stars with >800 reviews.\n4. Retention: Day 1 retention at 38.9%, day 7 at 25.3% and day 30 at 12.1%, all inline with industry averages for education apps.\n\nMore progress is needed to validate the following areas of TeachTap’s business model, which will form the core focus areas for Q3:\n\n1. Conversion: We converted 1.4% of sign-ups to purchases, generating a total of 367 purchases. Our goal is 5%.\n2. Customer lifetime value (LTV): The average customer LTV was $38.19, with most customers purchasing a single AP course for $30 and a few customers purchasing all AP courses for $150. Our goal is an LTV of $300 per customer.\n\nTo build TeachTap into a profitable business, our goal is a 4-5x ROAS (return on ad spend). We can achieve this with our goals stated above:\n\nCost per paying customer = $2 cost per download / 0.6 activation / 0.05 conversion = $66.67\n\nLTV of $300 per paying customer = 4.5x ROAS\n\nQ3 Plans\n\nIn order to achieve a $300 LTV per paying customer and to convert 5% of sign-ups to paying customers, here are the initiatives we have planned for Q3..."
