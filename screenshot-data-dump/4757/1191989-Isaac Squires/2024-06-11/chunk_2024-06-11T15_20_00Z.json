Using AI, we want to make 'reading what you love' possible like never before.\n\nQ2 Progress\nIn Q2, we shipped an MVP, and we have started acquiring users through paid ads over the past few weeks.\nThe app provides personalized and engaging stories to users, aligned with their reading level. The user answers questions, demonstrating their understanding of the text and enabling us to guide their reading level. Key features:\nStory Builder: enables users to build their own stories, based on their interests. They can choose the characters, setting, plot, and genre.\nCharacter creation: users can create their own characters to add to their stories\nAdaptive recommendation: stories are aligned to Lexile levels, and the user is presented with stories at their reading level, adjusting based on quiz results.\nCoins to Robux: Users are awarded coins based on their quiz results, which they can then redeem as Robux (Roblox currency).\n\nQ3 Plans\nIn Q3, we will completely focus our efforts on finding the people who are our target market, curating a user conversion funnel that brings them into the app to gain users and insights to improve the product.\nWe have a long list of potential ideas that could drive engagement and adoption, ranging from AI face swaps in story images, to new rewards mechanisms. We will let user insights and feedback drive which of those to prioritize in Q3."
