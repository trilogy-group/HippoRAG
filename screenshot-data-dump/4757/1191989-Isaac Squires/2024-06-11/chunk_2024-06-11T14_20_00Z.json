  "activitySummary": [
    "The user is engaged in a Google Meet video conference, as indicated by the active tab in the Chrome browser. The meeting involves multiple participants, including Bogdan Tenea, Phil Hewinson, Serban Petrescu, and Isaac Squires. Bogdan Tenea is presenting a Google Sheets document titled 'WS Eng. Product Decomposition & Engineer Ownership.' The document contains various sections related to different engineering teams and their responsibilities. The user is actively participating in the meeting, as evidenced by the in-call messages exchanged with other participants.",
    "The user is also viewing a Google Sheets document during the meeting. The document is a detailed spreadsheet that outlines the responsibilities and tasks of different engineering teams. The user is likely discussing or reviewing the contents of this document with the meeting participants. The in-call messages sidebar shows links to the same Google Sheets document, indicating that the document is a central focus of the meeting. The user is contributing to the discussion by sharing relevant links and information.",
    "The user is utilizing the Chrome browser for both the Google Meet video conference and accessing the Google Sheets document. The browser's taskbar shows multiple tabs open, including 'Core,' 'DevFe,' 'WSFe,' 'DevF,' 'GT Sc,' 'Learn,' 'Team,' and others. This suggests that the user is multitasking and possibly has other work-related resources or tools open in the background. However, the primary focus during this time frame is the video conference and the Google Sheets document."
