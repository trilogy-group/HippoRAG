Presumably we capture the student's email during signup, not the parent's as well. I don't have context on how a student comes across and signs up to TeachTales, but I assume it's with their parents helping them - if that's the case, we should probably capture the parent's email address during sign up as well so we can have a way of emailing them - this could be messaged as sending them insights into their child's learning and development\n2. For the above student and others, we could then send a short report highlighting their progress with the key data points we have today - this process will also highlight the key gaps we need to fill (e.g., data to support evidencing that the student is becoming a better reader), plus it gives us a starting point to have a conversation with a parent to see what is most valuable in this report and what is missing so we know where to focus next\n3. Sending this report can then be a natural opening to ask them to have a conversation with us (in return for a cash incentive for their time) or if we're at a greater scale, it could invite them to complete a survey form where we can then select parents we want to talk to based on their responses. This could also be a good place to capture testimonials/quotes from happy parents that we can use in our marketing\n4. A couple of small suggestions on the UX from watching a couple of the Lorgrocket videos:\n1. During signup, it might be better to ask for the Grade after their name rather than at the bottom after their password - I only watched one video, but the user didn't click the grade dropdown after entering their password, so I wonder if it's easy to miss as you usually press \"Signup\" after you enter a password rather than answering another question, and we really don't want users to skip this otherwise all the content will be wrong level for them - putting it after the name makes it more likely users won't miss this question during signup\n2. I'd make clicking on the answer the only click required to answer a question - right now it's two clicks (clicking the answer and then clicking \"submit\") - this is twice as much friction as it needs to be"
