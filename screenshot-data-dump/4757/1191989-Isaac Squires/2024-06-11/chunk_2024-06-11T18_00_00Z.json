The price for 1-to-1 tutoring ranges from $50-$75/hour. The availability of 1-to-1 or private tutoring can be seen as a core value driver for parents â€“ this is because it is considered one of the most premium, desirable, and helpful forms of academic support.\n\n6. All providers have a limited number of practice tests, and a limited number of practice questions.\nAll providers have a limited practice test question bank (4-6 tests) and a limited practice question bank (1,500-4,000 questions or 40-100 per skill/standard).\n\n7. All paid providers provide a score guarantee, with some offering an additional satisfaction guarantee.\nAlmost all providers offer a score and/or satisfaction guarantee (link). Most providers offer a score guarantee of between 100 and 180 points. Kaplan stands out in this regard, only offering a +1 pt or 'higher score' guarantee.\n\n8. All providers offer the option to finance purchases.\n\n9. No providers make mention of leveraging AI within their offerings. This could be an opportunity to differentiate.\n\n10. All providers make it clear that their content has been updated for the Digital SAT, and all of their content is framed in a way that is applicable to both parents and students.\nAll of the SAT Prep websites are framed in a manner such that the content is applicable to both students and parents. Additionally, it is important to note that all websites make it clear that their content has been updated for the Digital SAT. Ongoing demands from tutors, YouTube SAT program reviewers, students, and parents suggest to other providers that they are paying for does not contain traditional or old-style SAT questions. Some programs do not make this clear, and students and influencers suggest to each other to clear to avoid.\n\n11. Only PrepScholar discloses their average student SAT score point increases.\nPrepScholar's average score increase is 180 pts, with 1,230 score start to a 1410 score end. They also note that the top 25% of students improved their SAT score by 370 pts.\n\n12. Some vendors, like PrepExpert offer 'family pass' whereby all students in a household get access. TeachTap should consider doing the same.\nUnlike APs which are mainly taken in 11th and 12th grade, many high performing students begin studying for the SAT in the 9th or 10th grade. This widens the scope and makes it much more likely that a given family/household with more than 1 student in high school likely also has another child in high school. This is compatible with the GTM strategy of targeting grandparents.\n\nFindings\n\nTop Resources Students Use for SAT Prep\n\nTable 1: Top 7 SAT Resource Breakdown - The 7 vendors below were shortlisted as a result of a deep analysis of the SAT market in order to understand the most resources that students found most helpful, which in turn were the most popular resources. The list below is in order of most popular (top) to least popular (bottom), with all of the vendors in the list being giants in the space. Other, less popular resources are listed below the table for reference.\n\nResource\tPackage\tPrice\tWhat students receive\tScore Guarantee\tUsefulness\tHow they reach students/parents\nCollegeBoard\tBase offering\tFree\t1) 4 full-length adaptive practice tests (bluebook app).\tNone\tLimited\tStudents"
