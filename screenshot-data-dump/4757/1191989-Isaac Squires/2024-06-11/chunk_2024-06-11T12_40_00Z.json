Our core work revolves around video creation, and we've kept up to date with the latest tools and advancements, incorporating them into our workflow to improve both quality and speed. Our primary AI tools are GPT, Claude, Eleven Labs, MidJourney, Runway, Pika Labs, D-ID, HeyGen, and Adobe PS generate fill. However we also incorporate Udio, Suno, Topaz AI, Dall-E, Playground AI, Stable Diffusion, and Stable Video on a semi-regular basis.\n\nWe've found that incorporating AI for workflow enhancement has made significant gains for each individual step of the content creation process. However, tools that try to manage this process from start to finish are significantly behind in terms of quality or reliability. Promising apps such as Plainly or Dora are interesting, but most outputs are similar to this, and simply can't be used for anything beyond an initial sketch. We keep tabs on all major updates and experiment with trial versions on any that show promise. Most of the progress in the content generation field has related to improvements in speed or quality at a granular level, rather than eliminate entire steps from our workflow.\n\nMark Nygren - AI Video Creation, Script Development, Audio Engineering, Project Management, Prompt Engineering\n\nTeam leader who manages asset creation with a complete understanding of expected quality, knowledge of the product, and first-hand experience working with the target audience\n • Began the initial test work on TeachTap with Neil, setting quality bars and basic prompts to evaluate it's usefulness for Autogen agents.\n • Pushed the video automation pipeline through Plainly and explored other alternatives. After a review of possible options, we decided a more custom process would be needed with the Plainly interface requiring too many workarounds to properly incorporate captions and timed scene changes.\n • Stayed on top of new tools and updates including MidJourney's cref parameters, Udio's advancements over Suno, Runway's lip sync updates, and D-ID agents.\n • Has connected the team with second brains from TeachTap and Magic Academy to assist with script-writing and website design.\n • Use of AI to create innovative content types - Boss Battles\n\nMatt Caponi - AI Video Creation, Web Development, Automation, Project Management, etc."
