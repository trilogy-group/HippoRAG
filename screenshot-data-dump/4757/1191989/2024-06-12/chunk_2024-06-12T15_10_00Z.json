We had most of the prompt engineering work to support up to ~1200L nearing completion before we trimmed the team, I'll have someone pick up the work later in the week.\n@Phil Hewinson thanks for the insights. I agree with your points about the sign up flow and the progress report. Work on the new sign up flow should start this week.\nChanges I'm less sure of:\n• One click to answer a question: I'm concerned that could lead to some frustration when a user misclicks, since the user will miss out on coins for the whole story (not just that question).\n• I'm interested to see if you get similar user feedback in TeachTap as you switch to the new mastery algorithm that decreases mastery on incorrect questions.\n• Collecting both the parent and student emails on sign up: the data's definitely valuable, but I'm wary of adding yet another field for users to fill in.\nThanks again for the feedback, please let me know if anything else comes to mind.\nP.S. We also had a second Robux redemption in the meantime :)"
